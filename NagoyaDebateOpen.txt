				Currently, Japan is facing a shortage of doctors in rural and remote areas, leading to limited access to medical care in these regions. To address this issue, the Japanese health ministry is considering the establishment of special regional admissions quotas. (SRAQ) The quota would be for students who are willing to work in rural or underserved areas. These students would receive significant financial support, such as scholarships and easier admission. In return, they would be obligated to work in those areas for most of their career. If they fail to fulfill this commitment, they would lose their medical license and face heavy financial penalties.

				Balance $stats 0, 0, 4

			THW ban foods that are inhumane ways for the purpose of improving the experience
				Balance $stats 2, 0, 4
				Veto $stats 0, 1, 8
				The consumption of Ortolan birds are widely banned in Europe for cruelty within the preparation process. The birds were traditionally captured alive and confined in darkness to induce overeating. Then, they were drowned alive in cognac, roasted, and then eaten whole. Similarly, delicacies such as foie gras (French) or sannakji (Korean) involve inhumane procedures during processing that cause the animals immense pain, but are still widely consumed to this day. These procedures are mostly undertaken to improve taste and add novelty.
			THW allow the popular vote to decide the Yokozuna over the current selection process
				Balance $stats 1, 0, 4
				Veto $stats 0, 2, 8
				The Yokozuna is the highest rank given to a sumo wrestler in Japanese professional sumo. Yokozuna are figureheads of immense popularity, becoming symbols of Japanese sumo during their career.  To become a Yokozuna, an Ozeki (second rank) must be recommended by the Yokozuna Deliberation Council (YDC) to the Japan Sumo Association’s Board of Directors. The process has no objective metric and is not public. Once a wrestler becomes a Yokozuna, they cannot be demoted to a lower rank. However, all ranks below the Yokozuna have objective metrics to each rank, and if there is a drop in performance, it is possible to be demoted. The Yokozuna selection process has often been criticized as highly political and scandalous.

			TH, as the Japanese right-wing, prefers a narrative in which Japan is historically depicted as a victim of imperialism rather than a regional power
				Balance $stats 0, 0, 2
				There are two competing narratives within the Japanese right-wing concerning modern history. The first narrative is that Japan was Asia’s first regional power that was able to beat both China and Russia, and that the Japanese Empire was a strong competitor to its Western counterparts. The second narrative emphasizes tragic events such as the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, wide-spread famine, and suffering during the Pacific war, instead preferring to depict Japan as a victim of military conflict.
			TH, as Ishiba Shigeru, W personally visit Yasukuni Shrine on August 15th this year, or the 80th anniversary of Japan's surrender
				Balance $stats 0, 1, 2
				Veto $stats 0, 1, 4
				One of the key reasons why Japanese prime ministers have made personal visits to Yasukuni Shrine is to rally support for controversial political agendas. Visits earn them the backing of the LDP’s conservative faction along with older demographics. Examples include Abe visiting Yasukuni to rally support for reinterpretations to article 9, and Koizumi Junichiro for economic reform. Ishiba Shigeru, the current prime minister of Japan, is currently deeply unpopular. He has made no visits to the shrine yet.

Some examples are Dachshunds (spinal problems) , English and French bulldogs (breathing difficulties) as well as Cavalier King Charles spaniels (heart diseases). While codification of torture breeding is present in documents such as the Animal Welfare Act, the vague wording and inability to implement broad scale legislature means most countries are behind in tackling the problem.

				Veto $stats 0, 0, 2
				For the purpose of this debate, heaven and hell exists as a space souls go to be punished or rewarded after their death.
				Hell is a fiery wasteland, where the souls of sinners come to be punished. The ruler of hell commands demon armies and oversees the punishment of all those who have committed great wrongs during their lifetime. This ruler enjoys complete and total control over their domain.
				Heaven on the other hand is a paradise under the rule of an omniscient, omnipotent deity called the Lord, where the souls of those who’ve lived their lives selflessly come to be rewarded. To maintain this realm, the Lord tasks his servants with a myriad of jobs without much explanation, and the servants work tirelessly to maintain peace and security.
				You are currently a servant in heaven, and you have been presented with the opportunity to become hell’s new ruler.

				Balance $stats 0, 1, 2

				In Octopia, the Wise Octopus rules as the ultimate authority over the population. The Octopus has complete control over economic policy and state decisions. Everyone’s basic needs are met, but there is no freedom of occupation or opportunity to create additional wealth. Because the Octopus uses its Octomagic to cast an Octospell that inspires unconditional loyalty, there is no dissent, and people work hard.  One day, the Octopus chokes on a fish bone, which weakens it and temporarily breaks the Octospell. Suddenly, everyone is perfectly aware of their situation, and the society is faced with a decision: either kill the octopus and create a democracy, or wait until the Octopus recovers.

			TH, as the feminist movement, W actively use Ghibli heroines as feminist icons over Disney princesses

				Ghibli movies depict heroines who must adapt and compromise with their difficulties, often utilizing the help of male supporting figures. Ghibli heroines tend to be more measured, realistic, and have nuanced endings compared to the happy conclusions Disney princesses enjoy.

The Wind Rises depicts the story of Jiro Hirokoshi, the inventor of Zero-Sen, Japan’s premier fighter plane, and his internal struggle between family duties and his obligation to the Empire. Both focus on the pain and sacrifice of Japanese citizens during the war, depicting them as victims of circumstance.
			TH, as Studio Ghibli, would begin utilizing generative AI in their work
				Balance $stats 0, 1, 1
				Veto $stats 0, 0, 2
				Recently, Miyazaki Hayao, the creative director of Studio Ghibli, commented that "AI art is an insult to life itself’ and that he feels ‘disgusted’ by it. The comments stem from both his discomfort in copyright issues surrounding generative AI, but also his intuition that AI feels soulless. However, research suggests that AI generated art would optimize Japanese animation production, cutting down costs and time needed to about half.
