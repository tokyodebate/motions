				"A draft system is where professional sports teams are allocated new athletes through a lottery-based system, rather than allowing the athlete's choice. Once an athlete is selected by a team, they are usually required to play for that team for a specified period of time, often several years (e.g. 8 years in Japanese baseball league, 4 years in American football league) , before they become eligible for free agency and can choose to play for another team. If an athlete does not like the outcome of the draft and they choose not to sign with the team they are assigned to, they may not be able to join a professional team until the following year's draft."

Therefore, in order to prevent damage to muscles and bones, the human brain is equipped with a safety device (limiter) that limits the amount of power that can be consciously exerted. We assume Limiter Removal. It is a technology which is capable of bringing out 100% of human ability during competition.
