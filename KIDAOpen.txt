They are inexpensive and irregular force multipliers that supplement the Navy in maritime law enforcement, protection and humanitarian efforts such as search and rescue operations. China utilizes maritime militias as part of their Gray zone Conflict Warfare tactics in the South China Sea. It is estimated that China has up to 20,000 vessels for its militia. Vietnam created its own Maritime Militia in 2009. Today, Vietnam has enlisted approximately 8,000 fishing boats, and 1.22 per cent of its fishermen, or about 46,000, as militia. Last October, the Philippine proposed to create their own Maritime Militia as well.

			TH, as a swing voter who supported ousting Park Geun-hye (박근혜), regrets voting for Moon Jae-in (문재인)
				In 2016, South Korean Supreme Court ruled on the impeachment of the President Park Geun-hye, due to series of corruptions, with the majority of Korean citizens' support. The current president Moon Jae-in was elected as a result of many swing voters supporting him over other existing candidates (i.e Ahn Cheol-soo, Hong Joon-pyo, Yoo Seung-min) in the following election. However, there has been a recent yet significant increase of swing voters who expressed disappointments in Moon administration, due to the ensuing disclosure of corruptions (i.e Cho Kuk incident) and the recent conflicts between the minister of justice and the prosecutor general.
