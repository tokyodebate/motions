		R1

			TH, as the feminist movement, opposes the “not like other girls” trope.

			Assuming feasibility, THW implement the “Literal and Universal Birth Lottery” system.
				“Literal and Universal Birth Lottery” is a cool word I came up with. It refers to a system in which parents do not raise their own biological children. Instead, they will raise children who are randomly assigned to them through a lottery in a universal/global scale. For example, a Japanese parent may be assigned a Thai child, and vice versa.
