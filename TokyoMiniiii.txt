				Kitagawa Utamaro was a famous Ukiyo-e artist of the Edo period from the chōnin (townspeople) class, renowned for his bijin-ga (pictures of beautiful women). 
				Before Utamaro, mainstream bijin-ga was dominated by high-ranking court painters. Influenced by strict samurai morals, they depicted noblewomen as idealized, emotionless symbols, signifying social status rather than inner life.
				In contrast, ukiyo-e artists were commercial artists who worked for publishers, creating a mass culture of the common townspeople. 
				Utamaro focused on women living in the daily life of the city: courtesans of the Yoshiwara district, teahouse waitresses, and nameless city mothers, depicting the inner psychology, daily labor, and sensuality. 
				This approach became immensely popular, establishing a major trend of ukiyo-e."
