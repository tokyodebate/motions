      This House believes that governments should set up a department dedicated to producing and submitting ‘Sokal papers’ to academic journals, removing academics that admit Sokal papers and shutting down faculties that systemically admit ‘Sokal papers’.
        A ‘Sokal paper’ refers to a fake academic paper that is submitted to a reputable academic journal that utilises the tropes and jargon of the journals field to write deliberately absurd articles and thesis’. The aim is to expose faculties and academics that accept these submissions.
