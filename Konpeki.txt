			TH, as you, W choose Watacompany as opposed to Yurikorporation
				Balance $stats 0, 0, 1
				You are graduating from university in March 2026 and have received two job offers: one from Watacompany and another from Yurikorporation. You plan to work at the company you choose for at least three years.Watacompany offers a demanding yet rewarding work environment where employees are expected to work substantial overtime, though it remains within legal limits. In return for the heavy workload, employees gain opportunities for a pay raise, early managerial experience, take on significant responsibilities, and build valuable client connections. In contrast, Yurikorporation prioritizes work-life balance with a strict no-overtime policy and a relaxed atmosphere. The job requires no specialized skills, making it accessible to almost anyone, and all tasks have significantly flexible deadlines. As long as tasks are completed on time, taking extended lunch breaks or working at a slower pace is not frowned upon. Yet, employees have limited opportunities for a pay raise.

			TH, as you, W choose to settle down with A rather than B

You handle stress, conflict, and communication in similar ways. However, you don’t share hobbies, tastes, lifestyles, or living circumstances.B is the opposite—you have the same interests, enjoy sharing time in the same activities, and have a similar lifestyle, but you struggle with emotional compatibility. You handle conflict and stress differently.
			TH, as you, W steal the drug
				Balance $stats 0, 0, 1
				Your partner was diagnosed with a disease and given three months to live. Around the same time, the president of a pharmaceutical company in the same town announced that they had discovered a cure for the disease. Clinical trials have shown the drug to be effective, but it has not yet been approved and is therefore not available on the market. You have requested at the hospital that your partner take part in a clinical trial in order to use the drug, but you have been refused. The only way to save your partner is to steal the drug. But that would be a crime. This person has been an important part of your life and has been with you for a long time.

			THP the capitation model to the fee-for-service (FFS) model
				Balance $stats 1, 0, 1
				Veto $stats 0, 0, 2
				Fee-for-service (FFS) is a traditional payment model in healthcare where patients pay insurance premiums to their insurers, and healthcare providers (such as a doctor, hospital, or clinic) are reimbursed for each service or procedure performed. The more treatments or tests a patient receives, the more the patient pays, and the more the provider earns. The cost for each service varies—routine checkups are relatively cheap, while advanced procedures like MRIs or surgeries are significantly more expensive.In contrast, the capitation model involves a fixed, per-member, per-month payment to healthcare providers, regardless of how many services a patient uses. Patients pay premiums to insurers, and their costs are often adjusted based on risk factors or disease severity—those with higher expected healthcare needs may pay more in premiums. However, once covered, their costs remain stable.
