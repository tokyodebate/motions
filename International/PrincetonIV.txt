			THO attempts at adopting zero-hierarchy workplace culture

				CO $stats 10, 6, 11, 5
				A zero-hierarchy culture de-emphasizes the role of seniority and rank in the workplace. A workplace embracing a zero-hierarchy culture could claim, for example, that every voice in the company matters equally. The workplace could have policies that allow any worker to attend board meetings and propose changes, or have hiring policies that believe someone junior might be able to walk onto the job and deliver immense value even with minimal experience. This culture was first popularized in some finance and tech companies, but has since been adopted by some professionals across many industries.

				The idea that relationships should be 50/50 refers to the belief that within relationships between men and women, all aspects of the relationship should be divided evenly between the two people. This includes equal effort in meeting each others emotional needs, equal monetary contribution and equal effort in shared tasks such as chores.

				Singapore, a British trading hub, joined the newly independent Federation of Malaya in 1963 to form Malaysia. The union quickly soured due to differences over how to manage ethnic diversity, political representation and economic arrangements between Singapore’s government and Malaysia’s leadership. In 1965, Singapore became an independent republic.

				Scientists have developed a synthetic airborne compound that, when inhaled, permanently alters the human immune system to make individuals allergic to all forms of animal meat and animal by-products (including dairy, eggs, and gelatin). The allergy is immediate, irreversible, and universal across genetic backgrounds. It is not lethal, but causes highly unpleasant symptoms. While the compound is non-toxic and harmless beyond inducing the allergy, once released it cannot be contained or reversed.

				CO $stats 0, 1
				For the purposes of this debate, assume that Heaven and Hell exist as destinations after death. Humans know that there is an afterlife, but not of its nature. Placement in Heaven or Hell is determined by the overall balance of a person’s moral actions and intentions in life, judged by an impartial standard that weighs both harms and virtues. Heaven represents a state of ultimate fulfillment and peace. Hell represents the consequences of one’s moral failings, which may range from suffering to separation from fulfillment, proportionate to the seriousness of those failings. These outcomes are eternal and irreversible.

				A parasocial relationship occurs when an individual forms a strong emotional relationship with an online figure or celebrity that simulates a real-life relationship (such as a romantic or friendship relationship), despite limited real-world interaction with them. Examples of parasocial behavior include thinking of a Twitch streamer you watch regularly as a friend, and Taylor Swift fans signing a petition to get her to dump Matt Healy.

				AI trading strategies refer to the use of computer models and algorithms to analyse market data and make trades. These models are often trained on market data and use machine learning to identify trends and patterns in the market, to provide for automated trading (wherein a user does not have to intervene once a set of certain conditions have been set for the AI to make a trade).

				After years of economic decline and a rise in insurgency within the region, the presidential guard of Niger successfully mounted a coup against president Mohamed Bazoum and instated a military junta on the 26th of July 2023. Supporters of the junta were seeing chanting 'Wagner' and waving Russian flags in demonstrations in the days following the coup.
				The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is a political and economic union consisting of 15 Western African states. It has a history of dealing with military coups in the region: sending peacekeepers to The Gambia after a 2017 coup for example and imposing sanctions on Mali and Guinea after their coups in 2021. So far, it has condemned the coup in Niger and placed sanctions on the country.
