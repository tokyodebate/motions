Kelly’s spouse makes a very modest salary as a preschool teacher, and has no qualms about Kelly working on these new weapons. If Kelly does not take the job, they are told that someone else without any reservations about the weapons research will take the job and will likely move the development ahead more quickly.

			As China, THW fund and arm the anti-coup movement in Myanmar
				On February 1, 2021, the Myanmar military ("Tatmadaw") overthrew the civilian government led by Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy (NLD). Since the coup, extensive violence has broken out over Myanmar, with frequent civilian-military altercations and mass violence committed by the army. The coup followed general elections last year, where the military suffered a significant defeat and refused to accept the results of the elections.
				In the status quo, China allegedly sells arms to the Burmese military and has blocked an official condemnation of the coup at the U.N. Chinese investment, firms, and infrastructure have been targeted by protestors.
