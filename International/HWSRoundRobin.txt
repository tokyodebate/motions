			This house prefers a world that includes the star chamber.
				The star chamber is a supernatural power (perhaps aliens) who randomly but accurately identify a small percentage of immoral action that would otherwise go unpunished, and then ensure that the perpetrators of these acts suffer to a degree that is proportionate to their offense.  This punishment is administered in such a way that no one (including the perpetrator) ever connects it to the immoral actions.

				For the purposes of this debate, there exists a safe technology which can accurately simulate the experience of being in prison.

In reality, even a long sentence in the simulation will be done in a matter of days.
		R5
			As China, THW fund and arm the anti-coup movement in Myanmar.
				On February 1, 2021, the Myanmar military ("Tatmadaw") overthrew the civilian government led by Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy (NLD). Since the coup, extensive violence has broken out over Myanmar, with frequent civilian-military altercations and mass violence committed by the army. The coup followed general elections last year, where the military suffered a significant defeat and refused to accept the results of the elections.
				In the status quo, China allegedly sells arms to the Burmese military and has blocked an official condemnation of the coup at the U.N. Chinese investment, firms, and infrastructure have been targeted by protestors.

			In the event that current talks produce a compromise Brexit deal, this House would put it to a referendum with “remain” as an alternative.
				The British Labour and Conservative Parties are currently in negotiations for a compromise Brexit deal. Any deal that is likely to emerge will be a “soft” Brexit.
