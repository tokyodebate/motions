				"Consistent Universe Building" refers to fictional systems which exhibit consistent in-universe logic. 
				eg. Full Metal Alchemist's ""Law of Equivalent Exchange"" states that in order to gain something through magic something of equal worth must be exchanged. 
				"Inconsistent Universe Building" refers to fictional systems which feature inconsistent and unreliable in-universe logic.
				eg. In Avatar: The Last Airbender it is stated that bloodbending can only be done under a full moon. However, in a later series a character is introduced who can perform it at any time."

				In March this year following the collapse of the American bank 'Sillicon Valley Bank', the second biggest Swiss bank 'Credit Suisse' was facing financial trouble and a collapse was highly likely. To prevent such a collapse, the larger Swiss bank 'UBS' purchased Credit Suisse at a fraction of it's full retail value, and with financial backing from the Swiss National Bank. For the purpose of the debate this is called a 'partially state funded bank merger'.

				The medical model refers to the set of beliefs and practices that view the person with a disability as one who medically suffered an impairment which is the primary cause of their limited functioning i.e. a blind person lacks eyesight so they aren’t "fully functional". The social model says that the cause of limited functioning is due to the social construct of normality and that by changing the environment people with disabilities can be seen as "fully functional" i.e. blindness is a part of who they are. Professionals and disability activists include doctors, social workers, charities, teachers

				The applications of Western Balkan countries (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia) to gain European Union membership has been discussed recently at an EU summit. Many of these countries have received candidate status and/or been told by the EU that negotiations can take place (however with no date). 
				A dispute between Bulgaria and North Macedonia on Bulgarian citizens in North Macedonia has caused tension amongst Western Balkan leaders as they believe it has stalled the EU membership of these countries due to Bulgaria's objection.

				You are a late 20s, single, female middle manager in a very large company, named Emanna Wuff, in a country with conservative social norms.

				When interacting with people, the button pusher is still aware of social norms and how others conform to them. The button pusher cannot develop the capacity to weigh social norms in the future e.g. from conversations, interactions, etc. 
				You have only one chance to push the button, only you can push it, and when pushed, the action is irreversible.
