				Political strikes refer to workers using strikes to protest against a policy decision by the government that is unrelated to the terms of employment of the striking workers (e.g. protesting against war, abortion bans, contribution of the government to climate change etc). These strikes are most commonly executed by workers of the public sector, striking against the government, their direct employer. These strikes are not protected, meaning employers are allowed to fire workers for participating in them.

				For the purposes of this debate, reincarnation is real. It happens in human form only, in a random (not karmic) way, and doesn't have to follow immediately after death.
				This is known to all and considered an undisputable fact.
				Humans have inherent traits that consist of their core personality and preferences. These get transferred through reincarnations and do not change. People are a combination of their inherent traits and their environment.

				The Dalai Lama is the spiritual leader of the largest schools of Tibetan Buddhism, with the closely connected Panchen Lama second to the Dalai Lama in the hierarchy. Upon the death of either the Dalai Lama or Panchen Lama, a search for the reincarnation is conducted in order to select a successor. The Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama each have supreme authority in the process of recognizing each other's reincarnations i.e. the Panchen Lama must approve the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and vice-versa. In 1995, the then-six year old Panchen Lama was kidnapped by the Chinese government. His whereabouts are still unknown, but the CCP have stated that he is living a normal life in China with his family. The Dalai Lama is unable to choose the next reincarnation of the Panchen Lama without confirmation that the current Panchen Lama is deceased.

				Evergrande Real Estate currently owns more than 1,300 projects in more than 280 cities across China. The Evergrande Group has expanded aggressively to become one of China's biggest companies by borrowing more than 300bn Yuan. They invested into a number of different industries ranging from wealth management to electric cars to the purchase of the country's biggest football teams, Guangzhou FC. Several factors have seen Evergrande's share price tumble by around 80% this year. Its bonds have also been downgraded by global credit ratings agencies and the company is at risk of bankrupcy.

				Benevolent sexism, as opposed to hostile sexism, refers to attitudes about women that are stereotypical yet have positive connotations (eg that men have an obligation to be chivalrous and protect women, the idolisation of women in wife, mother, and child caretaker roles and the romanticisation of the emotional sensitivity of women).
		Rookie Pre SF
			THP industrial unions to workplace unions
				OG $stats 1, 1
				OO $stats 2, 0
				CG $stats 1, 1
				CO $stats 0, 2
				For the purposes of this debate, a workplace union is a union that only involves workers of one specific company. These unions tend to focus on directly negotiating with the management of that individual company. By contrast, an industrial union is a union with workers from an entire industry (e.g. service workers, educators, etc.). Industrial unions, more often, focus on trying to implement industry-wide standards for worker rights rather than negotiate with individual companies.

			THBT Japan should revise Article 9 of its constitution in line with Abe's 2017 proposal
				OG $stats 0, 2
				OO $stats 2, 0
				CG $stats 1, 1
				CO $stats 1, 1
				"Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution reads: ""Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes. In order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land, sea and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained. The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognised."" 
				In 2017, then-Prime Minister Abe Shinzo proposed an amendment to Article 9. The proposed amendment would keep the existing clauses as is and add a third clause that would unambiguously legitimise the constitutionality of the (existing) Japan Self-Defense Force. Abe resigned in 2020 citing poor health. Article 9 is yet to be amended."

			THBT social justice movements should actively promote a belief in Radical Compassion
				OG $stats 0, 1

				CO $stats 1, 0
				"Radical compassion" refers to the belief that all acts, regardless of how right or wrong they appear to be, must be understood by adopting the perspective of the actor involved and considering the actor's intent and background. Proponents of radical compassion disapprove of moral judgment. They consider identifying and resolving the factors that cause harmful acts to be far more important than punishing a perpetrator. For example, proponents tend to support policies involving rehabilitation and mediation as opposed to policies involving retributive consequences.
