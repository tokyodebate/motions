				Bilingual education is a mode of education in which students are educated in two (or more) languages (i.e. some school subjects are taught in a second language). This is distinct from students merely learning a second language.

				Blue-chip art refers to work by established artists that have a history of creating art. Blue-chip artists build and maintain their reputation through traditional avenues such as art galleries, dealers and physical exhibitions.
				Red-chip art refers to work by younger artists who rise to fame relatively quickly through gaining an online following on image-based platforms such Instagram, TikTok etc. These artists bypass traditional avenues and promote their work mostly online. There is a slowly rising upward trend in prices for red-chip art on the art market.

				At the conclusion of the Cold War, the US and Russia substantially reduced the size of their nuclear arsenals and signed substantial arms reduction treaties, START I and START II. However, both states still maintain significantly larger nuclear arsenals than any other state. Due to the collapse of the USSR, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus became nuclear weapons states in the early 90s. The US and Russia both supported these states transferring these weapons to Russia in exchange for commitments to refrain from threatening them militarily.
				The US and Russia are both party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Under the NPT, states that tested nuclear weapons before 1967 are legally recognised as nuclear-weapon states, but are required to attempt to take genuine steps towards disarmament.

				A drag queen is a person who uses clothing and makeup to imitate and often exaggerate female gender signifiers and gender roles for entertainment purposes. Historically, most drag queens have been men dressing as women. In modern times, drag queens are associated with gay men and gay culture.

				Wolf-Warrior diplomacy is a Chinese diplomatic philosophy focused on a combative public presence, both in terms of rebutting criticism of China and criticising the actions of other nations. One of the most famous examples was Foreign Ministry of China spokesman Zhao Lijian criticising Australia by sharing an image on Twitter by Chinese cartoonist Wuhe Qilin. The image depicted an Australian soldier holding a bloodstained knife to a childâ€™s throat. The image references Australian warcrimes in Afghanistan, as detailed in the Brereton Report, and its sharing garnered significant global controversy.

				To become certified as a "B-Corporation", a company must make changes to its governing constitution. There are three important changes:
				1. The establishment of clear wording to "consider stakeholder interests" in company articles of incorporation or company by-laws.
				2. Define "stakeholders" as the employees, the community, the environment, suppliers, customers, and shareholders.
				3. Forbid prioritization of one stakeholder over another.
				If a company acts inconsistently with its governing constitution, interested parties can enforce its provisions through the courts. 
				Examples of B-Corporations are AllBirds (shoes), Patagonia (outdoor-wear), and Ben & Jerries (ice cream).

			THO the ascension of Naftali Bennet to the Israeli premiership

				Benjamin Netanyahu, has been ousted from office by a coalition of rivals, ending his 12-year run in power. Israel's new prime minister, Naftali Bennett was sworn in on Sunday after a vote of confidence with the narrowest of margins; 60 votes to 59. Bennett, the far right leader of Yamina party, will be prime minister until September 2023 as part of a power-sharing deal. He will then hand power over to Yair Lapid, head of the centrist Yesh Atid party, for a further two years. 
				Bennett leads a self-described "government of change" that is a mix of ideologically opposed politicians from the left (Labor), the centre (Lapid), hardline Jewish religious nationalists and a small Arab Islamist party. Bennett has long opposed the two-state solution - and the cessation of military action against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. He is in support of the expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

				For the purpose of this debate, the "test of god" refers to the narrative in which religious followers are taught that their difficulties in life (which may include but are not limited to personal struggles, relationship woes, economic difficulties, natural disasters) are tests of God through which their spiritual and emotional strengths are tested.
