				For the purpose of this debate, "cut-off culture" refers to the social phenomenon of figuratively cutting people out of one's life. Anyone from acquaintances to significant figures which may include, but are not limited to, close friends and family members are capable of being cut-off from one's life. This act is most commonly, though not exclusively, done at or after the point of conflict/tension within a relationship.
		R3
			THS the use of economic warfare (eg. tariffs, targeted sanctions, etc.) against belligerent states in order to force compliance with the rules of the global economic order (eg. opening up the economy, protecting intellectual property, not engaging in currency manipulation, etc.)

				To be spiritually fluid means to have the experience of being shaped by or maintaining bonds to more than one spiritual or religious community at the same time. To illustrate an example, many Japanese people go in droves to Shinto shrines during New Year, learn morality based on Confucianism, host Christian weddings, and die in Buddhist temples.

				In the Indian subcontinent, the Hijras are a socio-religious group of third gender people. They are commonly either eunuchs, intersex people, and/or transgender people. The members of the Hijra comnunity are often seen as mythological beings that have the special powers to bless, and place hexes. They tend to live in well-defined areas, with most living on the margins of society.

				CO $stats 1, 1
				De-dollarization refers to a range of policies countries can take to reduce their reliance on the US dollar. Examples include issuing national debt in local currency instead of in the dollar, having central banks hold gold instead of US Treasury Bonds as reserves, pushing companies to invoice trade in currencies other than the dollar (e.g. most commodities are priced in dollar terms), etc.

				The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has dominated the Japanese political landscape since its inception in 1955. At the moment, the LDP, with massive funding, has no real opposition. It alone currently has 276 seats in the House of Representatives of 465 seats and forms a coalition with Komei Party which has 29 seats. 
				Its political ideology is often seen as more conservative than the people: it opposes legalising gay marriage and immigration, it emphasises on traditional family values and nationalism, and it advocates strongly for strengthening Japanâ€™s relationship with the US and further militarisation of Japan.
