World Universities Debating Championships
	Belgrade WUDC 2022
		R1:
			In disaster-prone areas, This House Would replace all state rebuilding and reconstruction efforts with direct cash transfers to affected citizens.
		R2:
			This House Prefers the Franchise Model to the Qualifier Model for E-Sports leagues.
				Info: There are two dominant models of E-Sports Leagues:
			The Franchise Model sets up regional leagues, where private groups buy teams which cannot be relegated from the league. Each league is overseen by their own central authority and the league is owned by the teams and game developer. Teams compete in matches throughout a season, at the end of which an eventual champion is named for that league. Prominent examples of E-Sports using this system are League of Legends, Valorant, Overwatch etc.
		The Qualifier
			Model involves a set of independently run tournaments ranging from smaller regional events to major tournaments that require qualification or invitation based on success at previous tournaments. All of the tournaments are run by different organizations or actors, which can have different criteria for inviting or allowing teams to participate. Prominent examples of E-Sports using this system are CS:GO, Dota 2 etc.
		R3:
			This House Believes That LGBTQ+ movements in developing countries should integrate patriotism into their messaging* *including actions such as celebrating LGBTQ+ soldiers, talking openly about being "queer and a patriot", displaying the pride flag with the national symbol, and avoiding actions such as supporting independence movements within the country or publicly criticizing nationalism.
		R4:
			This House Would prohibit companies from regulating the private behaviors of their employees in employment contracts* *e.g., mandatory drug tests, no smoking policies, regulating their employees' social media, prohibiting models/actors from dating etc.
		R5:
			This House Opposes the emphasis on the struggle against the Ottoman Empire in the history curriculum of Balkan countries.
				Info: In many Balkan countries that were under Ottoman rule from the 14th to the 19th century (e.g. Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia, etc.), the history curriculum focuses heavily on the national struggle against the Ottoman Empire as well as the crimes of the Ottomans against the local population (e.g. forcibly taking children to join the Janissary military corps, forcible conversions from Orthodox Christianity to Islam, murder and torture of local population etc.). In these countries, the Ottoman Empire is viewed as a colonizer, and those who led national uprisings fighting for independence are revered as national heroes.
		R6:
			In times of economic crisis, This House Would implement fiscal central banking.
				Info: For the purposes of this debate, "fiscal central banking" refers to an economic system that grants central banks the mandate to control circulation of money in the economy through fiscal policy in addition to monetary policy. Under this system central banks can define limitations for the size of the budget, but not its distribution. i.e. they can decide rates for various taxes and limit or increase overall government spending, but can't decide what the money is spent on.
		R7:
			This House Opposes the popularization of therapy speak.
				Info: "Therapy speak" refers to the significant expansion of psychological and medical language and concepts to daily life, outside of the academic context. This could include but is not limited to: - using terms like "toxic" or "gaslighting" when talking about interactions, friendships, or relationships in situations that do not meet the academic definition of these terms - referring to the urge to tidy up as "OCD", or a temporary inability to focus as "ADHD" - partaking in speculative psychiatric diagnoses of others, including public figures
		R8:
			This House Prefers that the Eastern bloc countries had formed their own Union instead of joining the European Union (EU).
				Info: In 2004, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia joined the European Union (EU), followed by Bulgaria and Romania in 2007, and Croatia in 2013. For the purposes of this debate, the above countries are 'the Eastern bloc'. Serbia, Bosnia, and Northern Macedonia, along with other countries, are not currently part of the EU, but are aspiring to join the EU.
		R9:
			This House Opposes the pressure to focus on promoting one's career at the expense of forming a family.
		EFL Semi Finals:
			This House Would grant the power to pardon convicted criminals to pardoning committees instead of government executives (e.g. presidents, governors etc.).
				Info: For the purposes of this debate, pardoning committees are made up of random citizens from the local community, similar to how jury panels are constructed. Convicted criminals can apply for a pardon, to be reviewed by the pardoning committee.
		EFL Grand Finals:
			This House Prefers a world in which humans cannot experience nostalgia* *Nostalgia is a sentimental longing or wistful affection for something in the past, typically for a period or place with happy personal associations.
		ESL Quarter Finals:
			This House Opposes the rise in anti-establishment discourse.
		ESL Semi Finals:
			Behind a veil of ignorance, This House Prefers to be born with an exceptionally high sense of self-awareness* *Self-awareness is one's innate ability to consciously know and understand their own character, feelings, motives, and desires.
		ESL Grand Finals:
			This House Supports the 10 pilots flying to their death.
				Info: It is the 6th of April, 1941. The bombing of Belgrade by Nazi Germany began at dawn. The air force of Belgrade consists of 10 airplanes and 10 pilots to operate the airplanes. Knowing that they are going into certain death, and that they are unlikely to change the outcome of the bombing, the 10 pilots decide to take to the skies to take down as many Nazi airplanes as they can before dying.
		Open Partial Double Octo Finals:
			This House Believes That the environmental movement should take more radical action in the fight against climate change (e.g., blocking roads, vandalism, blowing up pipelines etc.).
		Open Octo Finals:
			This House Would ban corporate residential landlords* *Corporate residential landlords refers to corporations that own and maintain multiple apartments for the purpose of renting them out for residential use.
		Open Quarter Finals:
			This House Would ban the use of advanced analytics in political campaigns.
				Info: Advanced Analytics is the autonomous or semi-autonomous examination of data or content. It involves using sophisticated techniques such as machine learning algorithms, deep learning, predictive modelling, or other tools to discover deeper insights, make predictions, or generate recommendations. Advanced Analytics can be used for political microtargeting, which involves identifying the detailed profile of individual voters and voter groups, testing the most persuasive messages, and tailoring campaign strategy to target different voter profiles.
		Open Semi Finals:
			This House Prefers religions that "center the self" to religions that "reject the self".
				Info: For the purposes of this debate, religions that "center the self" embrace human existence and individual experiences as special. Believers are asked to consider their choices and experiences, struggles, and connection to God as uniquely important and a path to salvation. In contrast, religions that "reject the self" explicitly reject the idea that human existence and individual experiences are special. Believers are asked to accept individual experiences as temporary and unimportant, and individuality as an illusion that causes unhappiness.
		Open Grand Finals: This House Supports a decline in global reliance on the dollar.
	Korea WUDC (2021)
		R1:
			TH, as South Korea, would aim to significantly increase its cross-border economic cooperation with North Korea
		R2:
			THW ban social media companies from independently deplatrforming politicians
		R3:
			TH prefers environmental movements heavily prioritizing a local agenda over a global one (e.g., focusing on local pollution rather than climate change)
		R4:
			TH opposes the glorification of professional e-sports players
		R5:
			TH opposes the general approach of companies to grow by massively sacrificing short-term profitability with the hope of gaining a large portion of the market*
				*e.g. the original business model of companies such as Uber or Amazon
		R6:
			THBT it is in the interest of the Catholic church to officially recognize Folk Saints
				Folk Saints are dead people recognized by the general population as saints who were not officially acknowledged as saints by the Catholic church. Unlike regular saints, they lived lives that the church considers sinful. They are popular in many regions, especially in Latin America. Examples include Sarita Colonia that answers the prayers of sex workers & LGBT people; and Juan Soldado that answers the prayers of people who commit low-level crimes out of financial desperation.
		R7:
			THBT pursuing strong expansionist policies* in the Arctic region is in the Russian interest
				*Including but not limited to: building artificial islands in order to claim additional territory, trying to significantly limit foreign presence, stationing warships and troops
		R8:
			TH opposes the academisation* of social justice movements
				*The increasingly significant presence of academics and academic terminology, processes and structures in many parts of the world
		R9:
			THBT states should classify organized crime syndicates as terrorist groups*
				*classification as a terrorist group would legally allow law enforcement to pursue tactics such as targeted extra-judicial killings, reducing barriers to law enforcement gathering evidence, using military forces, criminalizing membership, etc
		ESL_Quarters:
			TH would teach children to have a logical approach to life, even at the expense of reducing their emotional bandwidth (e.g. trying to react in less emotional ways, prioritising logic over emotions when approaching problem-solving, etc.)
		ESL_Semis_finals:
			THBT police commissioners should be directly elected by their local community.
		ESL_Grand_finals:
			THBT governments would be justified in heavily pursuing Longtermism
				For the purposes of this debate, supporters of Longtermism believe that significantly more beings will be alive during the future, and that we should assign moral value to the unborn. Thus, they conclude that when evaluating our actions today, the largest consideration is how they affect the future. Potential examples of Longtermist policies can include encouraging people to dedicate their lives to reducing long-run existential risks, allocating a substantial portion of the budget to try and improve the welfare of future generations, or trying to expand humanity to other planets. Under a Longtermist view such policies are ethical even if they come at the very strong expense of more immediate and certain goals like poverty reduction, providing healthcare or increasing the happiness of the living.
		Master's GF:
			TH loves online debating and supports all competitive debating being held exclusively online indefinitely regardless of external factors (e.g pandemic)
		EFL_Semis_finals:
			TH prefers a world in which the Resident Evil machine exists
				Resident Evil is a VR machine. It leads its user through a set of scenarios aimed at testing whether the user would diverge from universal moral norms. These norms could include not killing, not stealing, not betraying others, or similar. While connected, the simulated scenarios feel completely real to the user. All adults are tested on Resident Evil and their results are publicly available.
		EFL_Grand_finals:
			THBT international discussion forums should not self-censor* in an attempt to increase inclusivity to people from countries with stringent freedom-of-speech rules.
				*Examples of self-cenorship are: AI conferences avoiding discussions on the implications of the use of a certain technology by oppressive regimes; competitions censoring topics; moderators removing politically sensitive content from discussion boards
		Open_Octos:
			TH supports the rise of language-generating AI
				For the purpose of this debate, 'language-generating AI' is AI that can generate fluent streams of text after processing billions of words from sources such as books, articles and websites. Language-generating AI could conceivably have the potential to write press releases, stories, debate speeches, guitar tabs, scientific hypotheses, technical manuals, code, and more. In limited contexts, the latest versions of the advanced language generating technology were found to be indistinguishable from human writing, however the technology as a whole is still error-prone. Language-generating AI already has commercial & research applications by large organizations, and the technology is expected to rapidly develop in versatility & scale in the near future.
		Open_Quarters:
			TH opposes the Biden Administration plan to finance large scale governmental projects through multi-trillion dollar fiscal stimulus
		Open_Semi_finals:
			TH prefers to live an average anonymous life in South Korea over being a K-Pop star
		Open_Grand_finals:
			TH supports the creation of an international court with a mandate to prosecute leaders for health crimes
				For the purposes of this debate 'health crimes' are massive violations of the international health codes. For example, the unwillingness to comply with the WHO's regulations on dealing with pandemics, a significant violation of norms on the prescription of antibiotics, breaching the experimentation codes of ethics.
	Thailand WUDC (2020)
		R1:
			This House would impose a BBC-style impartiality requirement on all news platforms.
				The BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation) is legally required to cover the news impartially. This means: 1. It cannot take sides on controversial issues. 2. The amount of coverage each viewpoint gets should roughly reflect the level of support that viewpoint has in society. 3. It is not required to be neutral on certain fundamental issues like the rule of law and the legitimacy of the democratic process.
		R2:
			This House supports the rapid global elimination of both tariff and non-tariff barriers to free trade.
		R3:
			This House would allow children to sue their parents for religious indoctrination.
				Indoctrination means teaching someone to accept beliefs uncritically. In the case of religion, this can include (but is not limited to) emphasising strict adherence to religious teachings and not presenting alternative viewpoints.
		R4:
			This House would abolish the Olympic Games.
		R5:
			This House believes that the Mexican government should adopt measures that enable one cartel to monopolise the drug market. (These measures can include but are not limited to: targeting enemy cartels; selective arrests; stopping military deployments to areas controlled by this cartel; and renouncing the headhunt on its current leaders.)
		R6:
			In liberal democracies, This House would implement a Social Credit System.
				A Social Credit System is a national government-facilitated rating system that rewards citizens for good behaviour and sanctions them for bad behaviour. 1. It evaluates a defined set of actions that includes but goes beyond illegal or legally-obligatory acts (e.g., charitable donations, recycling, volunteer work; or jaywalking, and littering). 2. Scores can be given by members of the public, corporations, NGOs, and the government. 3. Based on these scores, the government applies rewards and sanctions (e.g., fast-track through airport security, government-subsidised mortgages, free public transportation; or higher tax, slower document-processing times, and increased barriers to public sector jobs).
		R7:
			This House believes that ASEAN should abandon "the ASEAN Way".
				The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) comprises Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. At its formation, ASEAN adopted principles that have come to be known as “the ASEAN Way.” These principles place strong emphasis on national sovereignty, and a commitment to non-intervention in the affairs of member states. All ASEAN decisions are made unanimously.
		R8:
			This House believes that the feminist movement should support the narrative that "beauty does not matter" over the narrative that "all bodies are beautiful".
		R9:
			This House would abolish primary and secondary school grades/years that group children based on age, and instead group them by competency and intelligence.
		EFL_Semis
			This House prefers a world where, starting today, all humans have identical intellectual abilities (equivalent to the current global average).
		EFL_Final
			This House would abolish the private ownership of (housing) property in major metropolitan areas.
		ESL_Quarters
			In a relatively equal society where the "protected sphere model" is the norm, This House, as a parent, would raise their children according to the "deferred happiness model".
				Under the "deferred happiness model" of parenting, there is strong emphasis on setting children up for a successful adulthood, including through a focus on academic or extracurricular achievement, structure, and discipline. Under the "protected sphere model" of parenting, there is strong emphasis on "letting children be children", including through a focus on playtime and personal enjoyment.
		ESL_Semis
			This House prefers a world without the Neuralink.
				A highly-valued startup has invented Neuralink technology, which allows people's consciousnesses to be irreversibly uploaded into a powerful supercomputer and maintained indefinitely.
		ESL_Final
			This House believes that the United States government should cede the authority to prosecute criminal trials involving African Americans (as either victims or alleged perpetrators) to African American interest groups, and allocate funding for this.
		Open_Partial_Double_Octos
			This House prefers religions in which all individuals have roughly equal religious obligations and are encouraged to develop a personal connection with the divine, over religions in which religious obligation and access to the divine are concentrated in religious authority figures.
		Open_Octos
			This House prefers a cynical and pessimistic perception of democratic politics to an idealistic and optimistic one.
		Open_Quarters
			This House believes that developing countries should acquire, on the open market, large stakes in major publicly-traded global corporations (eg. Google, JP Morgan, Shell, and Pfizer).
		Open_Semis
			This House prefers a "Brave New World" to the status quo in Western Liberal Democracies.
				A “Brave New World” has these characteristics: 1. People are genetically engineered and socially conditioned by the state for specific societal roles. 2. People's material and physical needs are unfailingly met. 3. There is no possibility of changing the social order.
		Open_Final
			This House, as China, would grant universal suffrage to Hong Kong.
	Cape Town Worlds (2019)
		R1
			TH, as South Africa, would forcibly break up exclusive Afrikaner* enclaves. *Afrikaners are a white South African ethnic group descended from predominantly Dutch settlers
		R2
			THBT the protection of international law conventions and treaties should not apply to combatants from terrorist organizations (e.g. prohibition of torture, prisoners of war status, guarantee of post-conflict release)
		R3
			TH opposes the norm that romantic love should be the primary source of fulfilment in a person’s life.
		R4
			THBT the ongoing process of decolonisation should include actively disempowering religions that were imposed in the country during colonialism.
				Decolonisation refers to the process of critiquing and moving away from value systems and influences that were imposed on countries during colonialism. Some examples include: removing statues of colonial figures e.g. Cecil Rhodes, prioritising indigenous narratives of history over colonial narratives, replacing colonial authors with local authors in curricula.
		R5
			THW implement substantial measures to impose long-termism in corporate investment culture (e.g. minimum holding periods for shares, yearly rather than quarterly financial reporting, long-term executive compensation plans).
		R6
			THS granting megacities autonomous control over their economic and social policy (e.g. immigration, health, criminal justice) with national taxation policy remaining under the control of the federal government. *Megacities = cities with a population of over 10 million people
		R7
			THW actively encourage women not to have children..
		R8
			THBT the United States should disengage from Syria.
		R9
			THBT developing countries should privatise their state-owned enterprises (e.g. airlines, railways, utility companies).
		EFL SF
			THW grant individuals and organisations open standing to challenging the constitutionality of laws enacted by their government.
				In most legal systems, in order to initiate legal proceedings, potential plaintiffs must demonstrate that they are directly involved in the issues of a case in a way that is distinct from general members of the public. This means that an ordinary citizen cannot challenge a law as unconstitutional if they cannot prove that it has, or is imminently likely to, directly affect them. A doctrine of open standing would allow anyone to initiate legal proceedings in court. Plaintiffs would still need to demonstrate a valid legal argument. For example, under the status quo, new healthcare legislation which may increase many people’s premiums could not be challenged by a general member of the public. Under a doctrine of open standing it could be.
		EFL GF
			THBT it is unjustified to assist evil regimes in systematically persecuting members of their identity group in order to mitigate and moderate the regime’s abuses (e.g. Israel Kasztner in Nazi-controlled Hungary, Wang Jingwei in Japan-occupied China).
		ESL QF
			THW subsidise art that glorifies the working class
		ESL SF
			TH supports governments significantly increasing their use of big data-based predictive models in decision-making to replace human judgements (e.g. criminal justice policy, allocation of healthcare resources, housing development).
		ESL GF
			In the lead up to the 1994 negotiated settlement in South Africa, THBT the ANC should have demanded further concessions (e.g. removing the amnesty provision in the TRC, greater land and economic rights) even at the expense of prolonging the conflict.
		Partial Double OF
			THBT the WHO should adopt a convention which bans the sale of drugs with high resistance tendencies (e.g. antibiotics) to countries which do not comply with WHO guidelines regarding their medical and agricultural use.
				Context slide: The World Health Organisation h conventions on various health topics, which can impose binding regulation on member states.
		OF
			THBT an approach of Political Expansionism on the part of the Chinese state is in the interests of the Chinese people.
				For the purposes of this debate, “Political Expansionism” is an approach to international relations which involves exerting pressure over and intervening in the internal affairs of other states. It seeks to spread ideology and exercise influence over the political and information environments of the targeted countries through channels such as economic investment and backing political groups.
		QF
			TH supports a norm of embracing anger in public discourse rather than one of aspiring to dispassionate objectivity.
		SF
			THW impose a narrow banking regulation.
				In the status quo, financial institutions use the money deposited by customers (e.g. in a bank account) to make loans and investments. Deposits could alternatively be used to buy government-back safe assets (e.g. treasury bonds), which tend to have the lowest risk of default of all assets. In this debate, an “equity account” would be an account where the financial institution can use deposits for loans and investments. The value of an equity account fluctuates based on the value of its underlying assets. A “narrow banking” regulation is the requirement that all financial institutions back up all deposits with an equivalent value of government-back safe assets, unless customers choose to deposit their money in an “equity account”.
		GF
			THBT the present condition of humanity is better than it would be in 100 years time.
	38th Mexico Worlds (2018)
		R1
			THW ban all communication tech companies (such as Google, Apple, Facebook, Whatsapp, etc.) from encrypting their users data, including the content of their communications, in such a way that the company cannot retrieve that data even under a court order.
		R2
			TH supports job security legislation.
				For the purpose of this debate, “job security legislation” refers to laws intended to make businesses fire employees less often. Its goal is to disincentives the termination of existing employees, whether the business employs an alternative individual to replace them or not. Examples of this legislation include, but are not limited to, increased severance pay and detailed cause requirements for terminating employment. Protections against discriminatory termination or similar laws do not fall under this term.
		R3
			THW redefine the criterion for excessive force in the US to be any use of beyond what is reasonable given all the facts of the case, including the benefit of hindsight (e.g. whether the individual had a gun, not whether it was reasonable to believe he had a gun).
				The current criterion in the US as to whether a police offices used excessive force is whether he acted reasonably given his perspective at the time and without the benefit of hindsight. Academic research has shown that when using this criterion, juries consistently conclude that officers harming or killing black individuals acted reasonably in almost all circumstances.
		R4
			THW limit the amount of time that a museum can display a given piece of art to 3 months out of every 10 year period, rather than allow museums to display their works as long as they choose.
				The art that you see in a museum typically comes from one of the following sources: i) that museum’s permament collection that’s always on display, ii) that museum’s permament collection that is mostly kept in storage and may occasionally be displayed (the largest museums usually display as little as 5% of their collections); iii) pieces lent to that museum on a temporary basis by another museum iv) pieces donated or lent by private individuals or institutions.
		R5
			THW allow citizens to vote on individual bills in place of their representative, with the representative retaining the voting power of those of their constituents who did not directly vote on that specific bill.
		R6
			THBT all states should mandate that research on and use of CRISPR technology be exclusively carried out by institutions funded entirely by the state.
				CRISPR is currently the only existing technology that allows cheap, fast and targeted gene edition in living organisms. It potentially allows for heritable* changes, though so far very little research on such heritable changes in humans has occurred. * heritable changes are changes that can be passed on from parents to their children.
		R7
			TH, as Iran, would cease all support for military groups in the Middle East (e.g. Hezbollah, Hamas, Houthis, etc.).
		R8
			TH prefers a world in which all individuals who have achieved a middle class standard of living choose to pursue the highest level of achievement in their chosen career, rather than a wold in which those individuals priorities day-to-day enjoyment over work.
		R9
			THW not allow out of court settlements for workplace discrimination and harrasment.
		PD-OF
			THBT ASEAN should negotiate all investment deals with Chinese government entities as a bloc (with decisions made by majority vote of its members), so that no member state can enter into investment deals without the rest of the world
			The Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) is a regional intergovernmental organisation comprising of Southeast Asian states which promotes Pan-Asianism and greater economic integration within the ASEAN common market. There are 10 ASEAN member states, namely, Malaysia, Singapore, Myanmar, Thailand, Indonesia, Brunei, Philippines, Cambodia, Loas, & Vietnam.
		ESL QF
			TH, as the Chinese Communist Party, would lift all restrictions on foreign investments in China, except restrictions critical to national security
			There are currently a number of restrictions on foreign entities investing in China. Such restrictions include, but are not limited to: government approval for large foreign investments in China; limitations on the proportion of certain sectors that can be owned by foreign entities; and foreign companies that enter China are required to do so in a 50% joint venture with a local firm.
		OF
			TH supports the court’s decision to acquit Tehlirian
			Soghomon Tehlirian was an Armenian whose family was killed during the Turkish genocide against Armenians. In Berlin in 1921, Tehlirian assassinated Tallat Pascha, widely considered the main orchestrator of the Armenian genocide. Despite conclusive evidence of his guilt, a Berlin court decided to acquit Tehlirian and free him.
		ESL SF
			TH prefers a non-adversarial legal system
			In an adversarial legal system (which is implemented in most countries), the prosecution and defense perform investigations, provide evidence, question witnesses and make legal arguments in an attempt to win the case, while the judge(s) are relatively passive observers and act as an impartial referee. In a non-adversarial legal system, the judge takes responsibility for most of the investigative process – questioning defendants and witnesses, ordering searches to be done – in an attempt to gather facts and look for any and all evidence in an impartial way. The prosecution and defense may be questioned by the judge, but have no control over the proceedings, and perform a minor role within the court.
		EFL SF
			THBT Catholic religious officials in Mexico should not make statements in support of governmental policies, political parties, or candidates.
		QF
			Individuals with Anti-Social Personality Disorder (ASPD), formerly known as sociopathy, have a highly reduced ability to feel empathy. People with ASPD do potentially have the ability to feel empathy, and, as with other emotions, their capacity to feel empathy can be increased based on exposure to certain experiences and relationships, yet is unlikely to reach what is considered a “normal” level.
			TH, as a parent of a child of ASPD, would enable and support that child given that child’s aims based on their current psychological makeup, instead of trying to make them more empathetic
		SF
			THW create an international court with the ability to classify national debt as “odious debt” at the debtor nation’s request and remove the obligation of that nation to repay
		ESL GF
			In democratic post-colonial states, THBT opposition parties to the party of independence should claim and use the legacy of anti-colonial resistance.
		GF
			With a spare $1,000, one can provide (on average) a single child, who would otherwise have died in infancy, with a full and healthy life – for example, by donating to the distribution of insecticide-treated anti-malaria bed nets. Alternatively, one can (on average) increase the life expectancy of about 5 adults by 10 years – for example, by donating to the therapy for deadly acquired diseases in the developing world
			THW rather save the list of a single child, over extending the life of 5 adults by 10 years
	37th Dutch Worlds (2017)
		R1
			THBT post-genocidal regimes should destroy all places of extermination (for example, death camps).
		R2
			THW allow members of the armed forces to form labour unions
		R3
			THBT sports leagues should significantly tax and redistribute from wealthier teams to poorer teams
		R4
			In areas with rapidly rising property prices, THW suspend all restrictions on property development that are not health and safety requirements (for example, environmental zoning regulations, building height restrictions, and regulations on the appearance of buildings)
		R5
			THBT the Netherlands should allow citizens to purchase additional votes from the government at a cost proportional to their wealth (for example, one additional vote for 1% of wealth)
				The Netherlands has a political system with many political parties in which no one party typically gets a majority of the vote. Seats in the parliament are allocated in proportion to the number of votes received by each party on a national level (‘proportional representation’). The government is formed by the coalition of parties that has a majority in the parliament.
		R6
			THB the world would be a better place if women from privileged backgrounds turned down any benefits arising from AA programs.
		R7
			THBT S Korea should produce nuclear weapons.
		R8
			THR the glamorization of start-up culture that encourages people to start own companies rather than puruse traditional career paths
		R9
			THW temporarily and significantly relax minimum labour standards in times of unusually high unemployment, including workplace health and safety standards, minumum wage, working hour restrictions etc.
		Partial Double OF
			THBT countries close to conflict zones should only grant long-term asylum to refugees who agree to one year of military service.
		ESL QF
			THBT the U.S. should provide campaign funding for federal and state confressmen and senators who score highly on bipartisan metrics*. *Info: Scores derived from instances of voting with the other party, co-sponsoring bills, etc., calculated by independent bodies.
		Open OF
			THW ban advocacy for religious belief in public places
		ESL SF
			TH, as the pope, would abolish the requirement for clerical celibacy.
		EFL GF
			THBT the European left should promote a hard left agenda, including the nationalisation of major industry, very high tax rates on wealthy, and expansion of the welfare states.
		ESL GF
			THW force all news organisations to operate as non-profits
		Open SF
			TH, as the Chinese Communist Party, will allow fair and competitive elections for local elections
		Open GF
			THW apply universal jurisdiction to crimes against the environment
	36th Thessaloniki Worlds (2016)
		R1
			THW allow states to use mercenary forces in combat roles in active military operations.
				Mercenaries are soldiers for hire outside of national armed forces. They can be hired either as individuals contracted by a state or through companies offering these services to a state.
		R2
			THW would prohibit private ownership of art deemed to be culturally or historically significant
		R3
			THBT all states should collectively aggregate and evenly distribute all revenue from mineral wealth globally on a per capita basis
		R4
			THBT governments with racially diverse populations should never record the ethnic or racial background of their residents.
		R5
			TH believes the US should withdraw from East Asia and cede regional hegemony to China.
		R6
			THBT states should adopt sunset clauses that legally force them to review and either re-authorize or revise their constitutions every generation.
				A sunset clause is a legal measure that provides that the law in which it is contained shall expire after a specific date, unless further action is taken to extend it.
		R7
			TH supports stronger collective bargaining rights and protections rather than legislated labor market regulations (e.g., wage levels and working conditions)
		R8
			THBT the creation of feminist icons and their cults of personality are good for the feminist movement
		R9
			THBT that criminal punishments should be based only on the offenders’ culpability rather than the damages caused by the criminal act or other outcomes derived from the punishment.
				Culpability is a measure of the degree to which a person can be held morally responsible for an offense.
		Open Partial Double
			TH regrets mainstream commercial films that depict historical subjugation and/or crimes agains humanity.
		Open OF
			TH would nationalize all systemically important financial institutions such as banks and insurance companies.
		Open QF
			TH supports the establishment of a Black secessionary state within the territory of the United States, the founding of which is supported by the American government.
		Open SF
			THBT non-western countries who were once colonized, when fabricating the material culture of national identity (anthems, street names, holidays, flag, etc.) should privilege pre colonial history and notions of indigeneity over themes of anti colonial resistance.
		Open GF
			THB that the world’s poor would be justified in pursuing complete Marxist revolution.
		ESL QF
			THW prefer a world in which extremely wealthy people in Western liberal states donate excess money to their governments rather than to charities.
				The Giving Pledge is a campaign founded by Bill Gates Warren Buffett to encourage the extremely wealthy to donate the majority of theIr wealth to charity.
