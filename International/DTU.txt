			THBT the GERD will do more harm than good

			THBT the Pakistan Ruling Coalition should call for an early election
				The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) led by Imran Khan has aggressively rallied and tried to build pressure for early elections since the past year. Imran Khan was recently arrested by the military on corruption charges leading to widespread rioting among his voter base. This was followed up by a heavy crackdown on PTI leaders by the ruling Pakistani Muslim League (PML-N) led by Shehbaz Sharif.
				Meanwhile, the PML-N has made a simultaneous amendment to allow for appeals to take place against apex court (SC) rulings. This could potentially pave way for former prime minister Nawaz Sharif to appeal his lifelong ban on contesting elections handed down by the apex court in 2018. General elections are currently scheduled for October-November 2023.

			THW require university students from developing countries who obtained education in the West to work in their country of origin for a number of years after graduation
				Bonded scholarship programmes in places like Singapore and Malaysia facilitate the ability of students to study abroad at elite universities. These programs are paid for by the state in return for the student being 'bonded' to work for the state for a given period of time (3, 5, 10 years). Students may be bonded to specific epartments or just bonded in general. It is possible for students to occasionally default on their bond and pay back the cost of education at a large premium.
			THW legalise vigilantism in high crime areas
				Vigilantism is the private enforcement of state laws. The legalisation of vigilantism would allow proportionate responses to crime by individuals and communities. For example, reasonable incapacitation to make a citizen's arrest (and taking them to a local police station); surrounding the home of a violent offender to enforce a house arrest; etc. Disproportionate responses (e.g. killing a drug dealer, not in self-defence) would not be encompassed under this policy.
			THBT governments should aggressively prioritise encouraging commuters to use public transport (e.g. through infrastructural improvements, tax incentives) over subsidising the uptake of electric cars
