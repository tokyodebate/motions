				Under a cap and trade model, the government sets a "cap" on the total amount of carbon emissions allowed, then assigns carbon emission permits to companies. A base amount of these permits are assigned to companies, with the rest auctioned off by the government.  Companies may "trade" them depending on how much they individually pollute.
