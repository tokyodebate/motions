Motions for the Australs
	Bali Australs 2019
		R1
			That the United States should adopt a single payer insurance scheme instead of offering a public option in the private insurance market.
				Single-payer is a more general term used to describe a government-funded and run system in which everyone gets health care from one insurer. The ‘public option’ is a proposal to create a government-run health insurance agency that would compete with other private health insurance companies within the United States.
			That progressive politicians in the United States should boycott Fox News.
			That the Democratic party should elect a centrist candidate for the upcoming United States presidential election.
		R2
			That we should use predictive data to assess the age at which individuals should qualify for retirement pension payments, rather than a standardised retirement age.
				Data about their type of occupation, age, gender, and the health status of individuals can be regularly updated and used to predict when they are likely to be no longer physically capable of working.
			That we support greater restrictions on migrants’ access to civic rights (welfare, healthcare, voting rights, etc.) in exchange for more open immigration.
			That we should allow parents to raise babies behind bars.
		R3
			That the international community should recognize Somaliland as an independent and sovereign nation.
			That, as Sudan’s Transitional Military Council (TMC), we would hand Omar al-Bashir over to the International Criminal Court.
				Thousands of protesters took to the streets of Sudan in December 2018 and protests are still ongoing. It led to the removal of Omar al-Bashir from power, who had ruled Sudan with an iron fist for 3 decades. The Transitional Military Council (TMC) was set up, which promised elections in around a year. However, most of the protesters are not satisfied, and have continued to protest because they want an immediate transition to civilian rule. The TMC ‘arrested’ Omar al-Bashir, but he has been kept in very comfortable conditions and protesters suspect it is just a ruse.
			Assuming the Sudanese civilians manage to take power from the military, That the new civilian government should revert to its pre-1970 flag.
				The current flag of Sudan was adopted on 20 May 1970. The flag is based on the Arab Liberation Flag shared by Egypt, Iraq, Syria and Yemen that uses a subset of the Pan-Arab colours, symbolising a shift towards Pan-Arabism. Prior to the 1969 military coup of Gaafar Nimeiry, a blue-yellow-green tricolour design was used. The colours of the flag represented the River Nile (blue), the Sahara (yellow) and farmlands (green). They were chosen as they were neutral between ethnic groups and political parties.
		R4
			That, as an evangelical conservative leader in a red/swing state, we should endorse a third party candidate (such as Evan McMullan) instead of Donald Trump.
			That we regret the commercialisation of cultural/religious festivals.
			That you should start a new religion.
				You live in a patriarchal and conservative society. You believe that the fastest way to get change would be to claim God spoke to you and anoint yourself prophet of a new religion. You have confidence you will amass a strong set of followers. The only way to ensure success however, is to claim that what God said to you is final, and this is the absolute best version of moral laws.
		R5
			That we should ban the short-selling of shares.
				Shorting, or short-selling, is when an investor borrows shares and immediately sells them, hoping he or she can scoop them up later at a lower price, return them to the lender and pocket the difference.
			That we should force large companies to be fully publicly listed.
			That self-described ‘socially responsible investors’ should engage in shareholder activism with companies that have poor ethical records rather than excluding them from their portfolios.
				Shareholder activism involves engaging with companies in order to positively influence their behaviour.
		R6
			That we regret the prominent usage of self-deprecating humour by female comedians.
			That we support the #OwnVoices campaign that says authors should only write from the perspective of their own lived experiences and stories.
			That minority movements should abandon the strategy of ‘reclaiming’ words used as slurs.
		R7
			That, as an Islamic political party in a democracy (e.g. PAS in Malaysia, National Awakening Party PKB in Indonesia, Jamaat e Islami in Pakistan and Bangladesh) we would abandon an agenda of Islamic political reform and focus instead on provision of social services.
			That, as Qatar, we would abandon all attempts to reconcile with the Saudi coalition.
			That India should remove Articles 35A and 370 of the Indian Constitution.
				Section 35A of the Indian Constitution gives special protections to the legislature of Indian-controlled Kashmir. Specifically, it allows the legislature of that state to define who is a resident of the state of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), and prevent non-residents of the state from acquiring land within the state or settling there. Section 370 of the Constitution gives the state full autonomy from the central government on all issues other than defence, foreign affairs and communications. Together, these two sections make Kashmir functionally autonomous. J&K is the only Muslim-majority state in India.
		R8
			That we should abolish cash bail and replace it with an algorithmic risk assessment.
				‘Cash bail’ refers to leaving a sum of money with police departments in order to be released from jail after being charged with a crime but before the verdict; if you do not comply with a set of conditions including returning to face the trial, the money is forfeited. If a suspect cannot pay bail they are not released. ‘Algorithmic risk assessment’ is when a formula calculates the probability of a plaintiff’s return to face trial, and only releases them if that probability is above a certain, defined threshold.
			That reputational damage should not be a mitigating factor in criminal sentencing.
			That we should nationalise all provision of legal services.
		OF
			That, as China, we would suspend rare earth mineral exports to the United States in response to the trade war.
			That, as Hong Kong, we would prefer having remained under British rule rather than reverting to China.
			That, as the Chinese Communist Party, we would officially acknowledge and express regret for the Tiananmen massacre.
		QF
			That social media platforms should be held legally part-liable for hosted content that passes a certain threshold of ‘clout’ (e.g. pageviews).
			That we oppose the development of implantable Direct Cortical Interfaces.
				A “”Direct Cortical Interface”” (DCI) is a brain-machine interface that aims to connect humans to computers. While the technology for DCIs remains in its infancy, if developed, DCIs potentially allow humans to reach higher levels of cognition.
			That we prefer a world where digital anonymity is and was the norm.
		Open/ESL SF
			That we regret the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff in Brazil.
				Dilma Rousseff was the president of Brazil from 2011 until her impeachment in 2016. She represented the Workers’ Party (PT), a democratic socialist party responsible for a number of progressive reforms in Brazil such as mass expansion of the country’s welfare system after they took power in 2003. In 2016 she was impeached by parliament on grounds of corruption. At the 2018 elections, Brazil elected Jair Bolsonaro as president.
			That we support federalism in the Philippines.
				The Philippines has 17 administrative regions of various ethnicities and cultures. It is a Christian-majority country, with a small Muslim population. Most Muslims live in parts of Mindanao, Palawan, and the Sulu Archipelago. Currently power is concentrated in the central government. However, there is a strong push towards federalism, allowing the 17 provinces greater autonomy over their respective regions. One of the largest proponents of increased federalism is President Rodrigo Duterte, who made it one of his major campaign promises back in 2016. Some political dynasties, Muslim groups, as well as allies of President Duterte are also in support of federalism.
			That parliamentary democracies should have an upper house with randomly selected citizens.
				An upper house is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature (or one of three chambers of a tricameral legislature), the other chamber being the lower house. The house formally designated as the upper house is usually smaller and often has more restricted power than the lower house.
		GF
			That we regret the belief that there is inherent value in martyrdom.
			That we regret the norm of parents financially supporting their children after they become adults.
			That we regret the vilification of communism.
		ESL GF
			That the ICC should abolish the principle of complementarity.
				The principle of complementarity means that the International Criminal Court(ICC) will only prosecute an individual if states are unwilling or unable to prosecute. Therefore, if legitimate national investigations or proceedings into crimes have taken place or are ongoing, the Court will not initiate proceedings. This principle applies regardless of the outcome of national proceedings. Even if an investigation is closed without any criminal charges being filed or if an accused person is acquitted by a national court, the Court will not prosecute an individual for the crime in question so long as it is satisfied that the national proceedings were legitimate.
			That we should abolish the Common Agricultural Policy.
				The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is the agricultural policy of the European Union. It implements a system of agricultural subsidies, tariffs and quotas on imports of agricultural goods into the EU, and market interventions to boost prices paid to farmers within the EU for agricultural products
			That investment in sport should prioritise funding grassroots and community sports as opposed to elite athletes.
		EFL GF
			That wealthy environmentalists should purchase land and not allow mining or drilling on it, instead of donating to political campaigns for government regulations.
			That activist groups against companies with poor ethical records that sell physical products (ie. Nike), should protest by stealing merchandise from stores, distributors and factories.
			That climate change activists should exclusively focus on changing the behaviour of governments and big businesses (rather than campaigning for individuals to make small changes in their own lives).
	Australs 2018
		R1
			That we should select the players of national sporting teams by public referendum.
			That, as authorities such as the World Boxing Association and the Ultimate Fighting Championship, we would prohibit competitor trash talking.
			That all world records in sports where doping was historically frequent should be wiped clean.
		R2
			That we regret the romanticisation of success stories in education.
			That western countries should stop offering university scholarships to family members of ruling elites in developing countries.
			That academic journals have an ethical responsibility to reject submissions that defend colonialism.
		R3
			That we should replace progressive income tax systems with a progressive Zakat system.
				Zakat is an Islamic system of income redistribution where, each year, individuals have to pay a portion of their assets (including cash, property, and marketable securities) to the poor. It can also be collectively pooled and used for social welfare projects by the government.
			That we support governments using social impact bonds to address social problems.
				A Social Impact Bond is a funding model where governments arrange for private investors to fund a service provider to solve a social problem. The government only repays the investors if the project is successful. Metrics for success are set out in the original contract. If successful, the government repays the investors’ upfront investment plus an additional premium. Examples of social impact bonds include: In the US, Goldman Sachs bought a bond to reduce prisoner recidivism in New York, and will only receive a return if teenage recidivism is reduced by more than 10%. In Australia, the NSW Government arranged for investors to invest in a program that seeks to prevent family breakdown by keeping children in their families, rather than out of home care. The higher the rate of children staying in their families, the more the government repays the investors.
			That we should cap the loan limits given by banks to the largest company to 10 times the loan limits given to the smallest company.
		R4
			That progressives should campaign for the right to polygamous marriage.
			That we would prefer a world where everyone is gay.
			That women over 50 should be banned from accessing IVF (in-vitro fertilisation) treatment.
		R5
			That we should abolish village councils in India.
				India’s traditional village councils (panchayats) are local self-governance systems that operate in rural villages or remote small-towns. These Councils are comprised of local elders. They function as de-facto courts that adjudicate all disputes (civil and criminal) that arise within these villages and issue punishments at their own discretion.
			That countries should impose tariffs on China in retaliation for the Made in China 2025 policy.
				The Made in China 2025 policy is the Chinese Communist Party’s $US300 billion plan to heavily subsidise emerging manufacturing industries including robotics, autonomous cars, AI, biotech and aviation, in order to make China self sufficient in those sectors. There are also recurring concerns that China is pursuing this policy in part by stealing other countries’ intellectual property.
			That, as UMNO, we should maintain our ethno-religious centric political platform.
				United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) is Malaysia’s leading Opposition political party. They were the founding and largest members of the Barisan Nasional Coalition that ruled in Malaysia for over 50 years until the recent election. UMNO’s political platform has always been to privilege ethnic Malay-Muslims.
		R6
			That, as Disney, we would return to making animated films with darker themes.
				Many films in the Disney Renaissance era featured dark story themes that are less present in Disney films today. For example, ‘The Hunchback of Notre Dame’ featured themes such as lust, infanticide, damnation and sin; ‘Pocahontas’ featured themes such as colonialism and murder; and ‘The Lion King’ featured a fairly visceral on-screen murder.
			That we support fil, TV and literature that depicts historical events being resolved for the worse (eg. Germany winning WW2, the South winning the Civil War, etc.)
			That entertainment platforms (eg. Spotify, Netflix) should remove works from entertainers who have committed immoral or criminal acts in their personal lives.
		R7
			That we prefer the portrayal of God as an imperfect being.
			That businesses should be allowed to deny services to customers on religious grounds.
			That we, as a religious leader, would focus on behaviour of the members of our religious organisation rather than the behaviour of non-members and broader social issues.
		R8
			That individuals convicted for crimes that were later legalised should be retroactively released from prison (If applicable), cleared of all charges and compensated.
			That we should never prosecute individuals with low intellectual functioning.
			That criminal justice policy should be outsourced to technocrats instead of elected representatives.
		Double-OF

			That the Democrats should actively prioritise fielding minority candidates in the 2018 mid-term elections.
			That liberal European voters should abandon left-wing political parties and vote for centre-right parties instead.
		OF
			That we support pop culture icons (eg. Beyonce) celebrating Black Power groups (eg. the Black Panther Party & Black Liberation Army) in their work.
			That we support the narrative that we should celebrate differences with other people, rather than find commonalities with them.
			That we support the appropriation of cultural festivals (eg. Cinque de Mayo and Holy in the USA).
		EFL/OPEN QF
			That, assuming doctors could objectively quantify a patient’s pain on a scale of 0 to 10, they should be banned from prescribing painkillers to any patient below a 6 on the scale.
				A pain scale measures a patient’s pain intensity. Pain scales are based on trust where a patient ‘self-reports’ the pain they feel on a scale of 0 to 10 to doctors, who then prescribe them painkillers accordingly.
			That we should force pharmaceutical companies to allocate a percentage of their net income to research of critical diseases.
			That we should allow insurance companies to offer the terminally ill a 50% rebate on expected costs of end-of-life care in exchange for forgoing that care.
		EFL/OPEN SF
			That the African Union should cap the use of cultivated land for non-food crops (eg. biofuels, timber) in all member states.
			That the United States should re-enter Afghanistan to help the government regain control over lost territories.
			That, as the United States, we should launch a global infrastructure investment project to rival China’s Belt and Road Initiative.
		GF

			That, if it existed, we would support non-sentient artificial intelligence that imitated deceased loved ones in appearance, personality and mannerisms.
			That we support a world government.
		ESL GF
			That we support developing nations marketing themselves as destinations for ‘good time tourism’.
				‘Good time tourism’ refers to every form of tourism that allows tourists to engage in activities generally considered illegal or socially unacceptable elsewhere (e.g. prostitution, drugs, etc.).
			That the environmental movement should renounce all ties to advocates for population control.
			That we should legalise the sale of children.
		EFL GF
			Assuming it will not be discovered, that the media should declare the attacker as a white, non-Muslim individual.
				[Context] There has been a terrorist attack in a major European city. The suicide bomber’s body has been discovered, but cannot be identified clearly as it has been badly damaged by the blast.
			That Ukraine should censor Russia’s fake news instead of debunking it.
			That we prefer a world where news institutions choose advertising instead of subscriptions as a revenue source.
	UQ Australs 2017
		R1
			That we should require prospective parents to obtain a parenting licence prior to having children.
			That we should allow pro-life organisations to pay women considering abortion to carry their pregnancies to term.
			Assuming it is possible to copy the consciousness of the deceased onto another person, that we should allow the parents of deceased children to do so onto orphaned infants.
		R2
			That we should oppose fashion and beauty as tools of gendered self-expression (e.g. wearing of heels and makeup).
			That we regret the trend away from valuing art for its technical qualities in favour of abstract characteristics (e.g. conceptual intent, contextual appreciation, uniqueness).
			That you should not solve the murder in the remaining episodes.
				You are the show runner of a murder mystery TV series on a major broadcasting channel. The plot for the show was to be 3 seasons long, with the murder to be solved near the end of the final season. The show receives critical acclaim and has a loyal core audience. However, it is not commercially successful, and midway through filming the 2nd season you are told it will not be renewed for a 3rd season.
		R3
			In countries with a quota for refugees, that governments should allow and facilitate citizens to offer asylum to additional refugees in their homes.
			That progressive media in the Philippines should not self-censor coverage of extra-judicial killings where they involve victims with serious criminal histories (e.g. known drug lords).
			That the West should provide international assistance to the North Korean regime for the exploration, extraction and development of Rare Earth Minerals (REM).
				North Korea has up to 20 million tons of Rare Earth Mineral (REM) deposits, but does not have the technology to explore its reserves or to produce high-tech goods. REMs are necessary in technologies. Known REM reserves in the world are almost entirely located within China.
		R4
			That we should nationalise all residential housing.
			That we should require professional sports leagues to require open entry and exit for new and existing franchises.
			That we should cap lending to any individual, household or company below a maximum debt-to-income ratio.
				A debt to income ratio is the ratio of debt an individual or entity holds relative to their income. For example, if I have $500,000 of debt and a salary of $100,000, my debt to income ratio is 5: 1.
		R5
			That we support a pedophile rights movement.
			That we should abolish national representative sporting teams.
			That we support a men’s rights movement.
		R6
			That all European Union member states should hold simultaneous referenda on their EU membership.
			That we support China’s cap on foreign made films.
				The Chinese Government caps the number of foreign made films commercially shown in China per year (34 films were shown in 2016). Films allowed under the cap are selected based on likely revenue (which is shared with Chinese Government) and whether the film portrays China in a positive light and/or incorporates elements of Chinese culture or Chinese actors.
			That the Clintons should cease all engagement in US politics and public life.
		R7
			That we should ban individuals from self-harm as a form of religious penance.

			That anti-theists should donate to, and actively support progressive and/or liberal churches.
		R8
			That the state should compensate individuals who are found ‘not guilty’ at trial.
			That mediation should be mandatory before initiating court proceedings in family law.
			That all trials should be incorporeal trials.
				An “Incorporeal trial” is a regular criminal/civil trial that abolishes physical hearings. The judge and/or jury will still preside over the case with documents and evidence submitted for the purpose of adjudication and sentencing. However, the lawyers, plaintiff and defendant are not physically present. Cross examination will be conducted via written text or voice recordings, and submitted as such.
		ESL SF
			That schools should prioritise teachers’ knowledge of their subject area over their knowledge of pedagogy and educational theory.
				Pedagogy: Method and practice of teaching/learning
			That, as a teacher, we should contradict curriculum that we believe will be harmful to society.
			That we support the creation of body corporate/owners corporation/strata community in which owners are able to make prescriptive rules and regulations to live in the community, and can forcibly remove owners who do not comply.
		ESL GF
			That we should allow organ donors, or their families in case of death, the right to stipulate the recipient of an organ donation.
			That, where commercial surrogacy is legal, surrogates should be permitted to unilaterally withdraw from surrogacy contracts at any point, without any liability.
			That we regret the assumption that people who work in community-based or care professions do so out of genuine emotional attachment (e.g that nurses care about their patients, or teachers about their students).
		Open OF
			That feminists should support the provision of wife bonuses in pre-nuptial agreements.
				A ‘wife bonus’ is a provision in a pre-nuptial agreement which awards additional money to a woman on the execution of particular domestic achievements (e.g. keeping to a particular grocery budget, keeping a tidy house, getting the kids into a good school).
			That we regret the concept of unconditional love.
			That, in jurisdictions with abortion on demand, we should allow paper abortion.
				Paper abortion is the ability of the biological father, before the birth of the child, to opt out of any rights, privileges, and responsibilities toward the child, including financial support.
		Open QF
			That the Baltic states (Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia) should train their civilian populations in armed insurgency.
			That we support the mobilisation of Shia militia (eg. People’s mobilisation forces) in the battle against the Islamic State.
			That a state pursuing policies with the effect of denying other states access to essential resources (food, water, etc.) that could not otherwise be obtained, should be legitimate grounds for military action.
		Open SF
			That we would deny land rights to, and if necessary, forcefully relocate indigenous communities whose culture and way of life are responsible for environmental degradation (eg. timber plundering, destruction of high conservation value areas, seal clubbing, etc.).
			That Black Lives Matter should closely integrate the black church and elements of black liberation theology (the narrative that liberating the oppressed is the core of Christian doctrine) into its organisational structure and doctrines.
			That Muslims should abandon the usage of the label ‘moderate Muslim’ in identifying themselves.
		Open GF
