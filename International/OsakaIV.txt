				The charter of the Southeast Asian Games ("Games") grants discretion to the host country to propose the schedule for that year's Games. Although the charter stipulates that every Games must have a minimum of 22 sports, there is no maximum number of events or specified list of sports in the contest. The host country may select any list of sports to include in the Games, regardless of popularity, and decide on the number of medals to allocate to each sport. The proposal is submitted to the Southeast Asian Games Federation (SEAGF) Council, who may consider the appeals of other countries. Malaysia is set to appeal to the SEAGF Council over the schedule of the 2025 SEA Games, to be hosted by Thailand, for the exclusion of common sports such as karate, wushu, and Olympic weighlifting.td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}
