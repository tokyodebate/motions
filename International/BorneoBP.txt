		PF:
			THBT the GNA and its allies should abandon any attempts at peace negotiations and continue its current push against the LNA
				1. Oil-rich Libya has been in chaos since the Arab spring movement and NATO bombing campaign that toppled Gaddafi in 2011. Attempts to build a democratic state after Gaddafi fell, disintegrated into a new civil war between rival governments in 2014. Since 2014 the fighting has mainly been between rival centres of political power in east and west Libya after election disputes: namely the UN-recognised Tripoli administration, known as the Government of National Accord (GNA) led by Sarraj, and the Tobruk administration in the eastern city, which chose General Haftar to lead the Libyan National Army (LNA). While the GNA is officially recognised by the UN as Libya’s legitimate government, it holds little power on the ground, and some distrust its Islamist politics. Haftar’s supporters say he is a bulwark against extremism, while others see him as another would-be military dictator. 2. Over the last few years foreign powers have increasingly intervened in Libya’s civil war to defend their own strategic and economic interests. The democratically chosen GNA is backed by the UN and many western countries, but its main allies are Turkey, Qatar and Italy. The LNA enjoys the support of Russia, Egypt, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, France and Jordan. The recent escalation in fighting comes despite increased international pressure on both sides to return to negotiating a political settlement and to halt the violence over concerns about the spread of coronavirus. The recent loss of al-Watiya airbase dealt a significantly heavy setback for Haftar and will help Turkey expand its air operations in the conflict on behalf of the Tripoli government. The LNA’s foreign backers are likely to step up their support in order to counter a string of Turkish successes since Ankara intervened in January.
		GF:
			THS Black rights movements in the West's strategy of actively campaigning to defund the police instead of pushing for institutional reforms
				"Defunding the police” means reallocating or redirecting funding away from the police department to other government agencies and programs, funded by the local municipality. "Defund" does not mean abolish policing.
