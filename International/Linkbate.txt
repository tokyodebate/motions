Linkbate Debating Championships
	8th Linkbate Debating Championships 2023
		R1: Emigration
			THS the dominant belief that “friends are hard to keep after emigration”
		R2
			TH, as an East Asian (e.g. Korean, Chinese, Japanese), regrets the rise of K-Pop
				K-Pop, or Korean pop music, has rapidly grown in popularity over the past decade. K-Pop is performed primarily by Korean artists, although other artists of primarily Asian descent also participate in the market. The rise of K-Pop is also correlated with the popularization of Korean pop culture as a whole.
		R3
			TH, as a country with an aging population, would opt for policies that increase immigration (e.g. more visas) rather than policies that encourage citizens to have more children (e.g. tax benefits)
		R4
			TH, as the PAP, would democraticize (e.g. stop abusing incumbent party advantages and stop disrupting opponents)
				The People's Action Party (PAP) has been elected as the ruling party in Singapore for nearly six consecutive decades. They have stably attained a voter share of 60% or above since 1968 but the general trend of their votes have been decreasing. For the purposes of this debate, the PAP has stayed in power by abusing advantages of being the incumbent party (e.g. rules which only allow preparation of elections to start after an election has been called) and has disrupted their opponents (e.g. by censoring what the PAP deems as "false information".)
