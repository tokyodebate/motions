			THP a world with a single, unified carbon market over a decentralized, voluntary carbon market
				For purposes of this debate, carbon markets are where carbon credits, or carbon offsets are bought and sold. Businesses and individuals can buy carbon credits from organizations that engage in green activities that remove carbon from the environment (either directly e.g. by replanting trees, or indirectly by not polluting e.g. conserving a rainforest rather than clearing it for development). Buying carbon credits are a key part of businesses and national governments hitting their net zero targets.
				Voluntary carbon markets operate on an opt-in platform, where entities keen to sell, purchase, finance or support a credit market at a specific price can do so, co-existing with other markets that have their own price point, carbon offset calculation formula, and other traits.

			THR the decision of the ECCAS to suspend Gabon's membership
				Despite being a member of OPEC, one of Africa's major producers of oil (which accounts for 60% of national revenue), and having one of the highest per-capita GDPs on the continent, Gabon faces serious socioeconomic crises: a third of the population lives below the poverty line of US$5.50 per day, and the unemployment rate among Gabonese aged 15 to 24 was estimated at 40% in 2020. Following presidential elections held on 26 August 2023, the incumbent president, Ali Bongo, who had been seeking re-election for a third term, was declared the winner according to an official announcement made on 30 August. However, allegations of electoral fraud and irregularities immediately emerged from opposition parties and independent observers, casting doubt over the legitimacy of the election results. Amidst growing scrutiny and widespread protests over the conduct of the elections, the Armed Forces of Gabon launched a coup on 30 August and General Brice Oligui Nguema was sworn into as President. The Economic Community of Central African States is an Economic Community of the African Union for promotion of regional economic co-operation in Central Africa.The ECCAS suspended Gabonâ€™s membership.

				You are an individual who has discovered a machine which allows individuals to access memories and skills from all their different multiversal selves. When an individual accesses memories and skills from all their alternate universe selves, they have access to all their alternative selves' memories and can view different ways their lives would have unfolded if they made different decisions. The more an individual uses the machine, the more overwhelmed the mental space of that individual would be in juggling different personas.
