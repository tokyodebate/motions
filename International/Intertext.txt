				Veto $stats 0, 0, 2
				You are an individual who has discovered a machine which allows individuals to access memories and skills from all their different multiversal selves. When an individual accesses memories and skills from all their alternate universe selves, they have access to all their alternative selves' memories and can view different ways their lives would have unfolded if they made different decisions. The more an individual uses the machine, the more overwhelmed the mental space of that individual would be in juggling different personas.
