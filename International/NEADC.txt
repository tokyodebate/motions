				"Model minorities" is a term which emerged in the U.S. that refers to demographic groups who achieve higher socioeconomic status compared to other minority groups.Model minorities often achieve more-than-sufficient representation in particular areas of society.

				OG $stats 1, 3
				OO $stats 3, 1
				CG $stats 1, 3
				CO $stats 3, 1
				'Direct Cinema' emphasizes observational filmmaking. Directors avoid interfering with or influencing the subject matter to capture events as they unfold naturally, with minimal interaction between the filmmaker and the subjects. The goal is to let the events speak for themselves.On the other hand, 'Cinema Verite' embraces the director's presence and allows them to actively interact with their subjects. They may ask questions, provoke reactions, or even appear on screen.

				OG $stats 0, 2

				CG $stats 2, 0
				CO $stats 1, 1
				A main bank system is characterized by bank-centered financing, where firms rely on long-term loans from a primary bank that also plays a key role in corporate governance and risk management. The main bank takes on a supervisory role, monitoring the company's performance and advising on strategic decisions, especially in times of financial difficulties. In contrast, standard financing depends on capital markets for funding, with corporate governance driven by shareholders.

				OG $stats 1, 1

				CG $stats 1, 1
				CO $stats 0, 2
				Sweden is currently grappling with a significant rise in gang-related violence, including drug trade, shootings, and bombings which have started to trickle down to neighboring nations. The gangs mainly recruit youth from underprivileged areas where many of the residents are from immigrant backgrounds.The current right-leaning coalition government has gained popularity by emphasizing the necessity of aggressively tackling gang violence. There have been discussions around stricter gun crime penalties, lowering the age of criminal responsibility, deporting gang members with non-Swedish backgrounds, and involving the military in supporting police efforts.However, the left-leaning Social Democrats, the most prominent opposition party, has argued for more preventative measures and more resource allocation to underprivileged areas.

				'Resume padding' of charity refers to the strategic involvement of individuals, particularly students, in charitable activities with the primary goal of enhancing their resumes rather than a genuine desire to contribute to the cause. This practice has become increasingly common among students seeking to bolster their college applications, as admissions committees often view participation in charity work favourably.

				OO $stats 7, 5, 4, 5
				CG $stats 5, 6, 7, 3
				CO $stats 3, 3, 7, 8
				In divorce law, there are two ways of settling a post-divorce parent-child relationship.
				In 'Sole Legal Custody', one parent has the exclusive authority to make significant decisions for the child, such as education, healthcare, and religion. The non-custodial parent typically has limited or no say in these decisions.
				In 'Joint Legal Custody', parents share the authority to make such decisions and financially contribute together, albeit one parent not being physically together with the child. Joint Legal Custody still set exceptions where a parent would not be granted custodial rights, such as previous history of physical/verbal abuse.

			THBT the inception of the 'Mandatory Solidarity' mechanism is in the interest of the European Union
				OG $stats 3, 1
				OO $stats 3, 1
				CG $stats 2, 2
				CO $stats 0, 4
				The European Union (EU) adopted the 'Dublin Regulation' for handling irregular immigrants (e.g., immigrants entering a country through an informal process, including but not limited to asylum seekers). It stipulates that the countries where the immigrants arrive should handle the logistics, such as examining asylum claims and providing temporary shelters. This led to certain countries proximate to regions with a high population outflux bearing a disproportionately high burden, including Greece, Italy, and Malta (also known as 'front-line countries').
				To remedy this, the EU is discussing the 'Mandatory Solidarity' mechanism, which relocates irregular immigrants from front-line countries to other EU countries and imposes financial penalties should countries reject the entry of immigrants. This measure is still being negotiated in the European Parliament and is yet to be ratified.

			THS the use of 'short squeeze' tactics by retail investors in stock markets
				OG $stats 0, 2
				OO $stats 1, 1
				CG $stats 2, 0
				CO $stats 1, 1
				'Short squeeze' occurs when a security has a significant amount of short sellers, meaning lots of investors are betting on its price falling. When investors see the price going up, they start to purchase back the stocks, which makes the price jump higher unexpectedly. An institutional investor trades large volumes of securities on behalf of an individual or shareholder. A retail investor is an individual who invests their own capital, typically at lower frequencies and volumes.
