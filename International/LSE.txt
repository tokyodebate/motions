				In constitutional law, the bill of rights lists the rights that are guaranteed to all citizens. In most countries if citizens feel that their rights have been contravened by an act of the government they can bring a case before the constitutional court, arguing that a specific, listed right has been disregarded. Alternatively, the bill of rights could be replaced by a single, undefined ""right to justice"". Under this new system, if citizens felt that any right had been contravened by an act of the government, they could bring a case before the court arguing that their right to justice had been disregarded. They would have to show that the specific issue they are bringing to the court falls within the scope of the right to justice, which would be decided by the constitutional court based on argument and legal precedent.

				Job is a pious man who has no proof of God's existence or goodness, but believes all the same. To test him, God allows all of his children to die, all of his wealth to be lost, and his physical health to diminish. God does not offer a justification for this test, and Job is given no indication of what will happen if he continues to believe or renounces his faith in God.

				There are four grades of pine lumber that fall under the common class. They are the premium, finish, standard and industrial classes. The finish grade is defined as a board with a fine appearance and tight knots. Premium grade is similar to the finish grade but encompasses boards with larger knots. Standard grade is used mainly for construction where a less finished board is acceptable. Industrial grade is the lowest grade. It allows boards with knots and other characteristics of any size as long as the board remains structurally sound. These grades of lumber allow for larger and more frequent knots than the select grades and a generally rougher grain of wood.

			THBT Bobby should undergo the procedure
				There is a boy named Bobby. Bobby has faced massive difficulties with openings, learning even basic concepts such as reading and writing his whole life. He lacks basic comprehension of things that would be fundamental to most people, including the capacity to decipher the intentions of those around him or recalling things that have happened in his past. Bobby holds a menial job in a bakery, where he fulfils his responsibilities to a sufficient level that enables him to live a subsistence lifestyle, including paying for rent and feeding himself. Despite all of this, Bobby has always held onto the hope that one day he might be able to read, write and relate to people on the same intellectual level he is aware they possess.
				There exists a procedure, the ADS Operation, that would drastically increase the intelligence of a person at a rapid pace, with the potential of making them a once-in-a-lifetime genius. However, the procedure can only be administered on an individual once. Scientists are aware that the effects of the procedure are temporary. While patients who undergo the procedure will suddenly find themselves in possession of lightning quick comprehension, recall and creative skills, after a certain period of time (predicted to be between three to five years), these effects will regress and the individual will find themselves at the same intellectual capacity that they were before the procedure.
