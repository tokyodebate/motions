				Devolution was the process of providing a regional government, and autonomy over defined policy areas, to Scotland and Wales in 1998.
				Devolved powers are constrained to domestic issues (for example the Scottish and Welsh governments have control over their respective education systems, domestic transport infrastructure and health services). International issues are reserved to the central British Government (for example, trade deals, issues relating to security and defence).

				CO $stats 8, 7, 11, 20
				Recently, there has been a rise in left-wing criticism of liberal NGOs for failing to be intersectional. 
				Some examples include: the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights group, facing criticism for insufficient diversity in its workforce; and the American Civil Liberties Union, facing criticism for failing to prioritise free speech rights for specific minority groups.

				Record labels control music production, artist promotion, and streaming. They influence the type of music created and often favour solo artists over groups. Consolidation in the music industry refers to the merging of record labels and conglomerates. For example the "Big Three" (Universal, Sony, Warner) dominate the market, accounting for nearly 70% of the global music industry.

				Keynesian economics is a macroeconomic theory that emphasises the importance of strong government intervention (e.g. deficit spending, funding large infastructure projects, quantitative easing/tightening) to promote sustained growth.
				Hayekian economics is a macroeconomic theory that emphasises the importance of limited government intervention (e.g. minimising annual deficits, free markets, constant monetary policy) to promote sustained growth.
		POF
			THP a Common Law system over a Civil Law system
				OG $stats 3, 1
				OO $stats 3, 1
				CG $stats 0, 4
				CO $stats 2, 2
				In Common Law systems (e.g. UK, US, India, New Zealand) judges interpret legislation within the context of specific cases and create new legal principles that form precedents for future rulings. Common Law systems are adversarial, such that lawyers of opposing parties advocate for a case, and judges act as a non-interventionist arbiter. 
				In a Civil Law system (e.g. France, Germany, Indonesia, Japan) laws are primarily codified in legislation by the government, leaving limited room for judicial interpretation. Civil Law systems are inquisitorial, such that while lawyers of opposing parties present the case, judges take a more active role in investigating the case, gathering evidence, and questioning witnesses. 
				Juries can exist in both systems.

			THBT the IMF should declare China an intransigent creditor
				OG $stats 3, 1
				OO $stats 3, 1
				CG $stats 1, 3
				CO $stats 1, 3
				Under the IMFs lending policy, the IMF may declare a creditor country to be 'intransigent'. When seeking a bailout from the IMF, a debtor country must now:
				1. Stop making any payments to any intransigent countries;
				2. Agree not to seek any new loans from any intransigent countries;
				Until the debt has been repaid to the IMF.

				OG $stats 1, 1
				OO $stats 1, 1
				CG $stats 1, 1
				CO $stats 1, 1
				The divine right of kings is a political and religious doctrine of a monarchy. It follows that only God can judge a monarch, and that any attempt to depose, dethrone, resist or restrict their powers runs contrary to God's will and may constitute a sinful act.
				In a theocracy, without the concept of the divine right of kings, religious leaders and institutions govern the state directly and have the divine authority on earth.

				CO $stats 2, 2
				Celtic and Rangers (collectively referred to as 'The Old Firm') are the two largest football clubs in Scotland and currently play in the Scottish Premiership. 'The Old Firm' has been dominating the Scottish Premiership, and the number of attendees at their home games are equal to the rest of the top two divisions of Scottish Football League combined. 
				For the purpose of this debate, ‘The Old Firm’ is offered to join the English Football league structure, entering initially in the English Premier League.

				The EU Artifical Intelligence Act is legislation that regulates AI Systems on a 'risk-based approach'. Under this Act, the higher the risk to society, the stricter the rules (for example, increased document keeping, greater obligations on users and distributors, increased human intervention and oversight or, in extreme cases, banning the use of the system). This legislation does not apply to military and defence systems.

				CG $stats 8, 6, 9, 15
				CO $stats 10, 8, 10, 10
				In children's entertainment, a political message specifically addresses issues, policies, or power dynamics related to governance and public affairs. It aims to shape public opinion, influence political decisions, or promote specific political ideologies. Examples of children's media with political messages include "The Lorax," "Zootopia," and "Pocahontas"
				It should not be confused with apolitical moral messages, which focus on teaching universal values like honesty, kindness, and empathy, and are prevalent in most children's media (e.g. "SpongeBob SquarePants," "Dora the Explorer," and "The Powerpuff Girls.").
				The key distinction that makes a message political lies in whether the message primarily addresses specific political issues as compared to broader ethical principles.

				Transhumanism refers to a future where advanced technologies are used to augment and transcend the biological limitations of humans (e.g. brain-computer interfaces, bionic implants, customizable genetic traits). It is meant to elevate human capabilities beyond their natural level, as opposed to medical uses of technology aimed at restoring basic capabilities (e.g. prosthetics for amputees, curing hereditary diseases).

				"Commanding Distance" is a military approach according to which commanders should actively maintain social and emotional distance from their subordinates. When interacting with their subordinates, commanders following this approach will typically: not express emotions or vulnerabilities, not share details from their personal lives, avoid social interactions and maintain a purely professional relationship.

				The High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina is a position that was created in 1995 as part of the Dayton Peace Agreement that ended the Bosnian War. The postholder is appointed by the United Nations Security Council.
				The High Representative's powers, without judicial oversight, include introducing or repealing laws or constitutional amendments, removing public officials from office, and banning individuals from running in elections.

				In Spain there are two ways financial autonomy is exercised by autonomous regions:
				In the common regime the central government is in charge of setting and collecting most taxes, which it then redistributes between all the autonomous regions with the aim of reducing inequalities between regions. This implies that richer regions become net contributors to the system, while poorer ones become net recipients. Catalonia is currently under a common regime.
				The second regime is a chartered regime, where as long as regions pay a fixed amount to the central government, they are allowed full control over setting and collecting non-VAT taxes (including raising or lowering tax). Currently only Basque Country and Navarre have a chartered regime.

				CO $stats 1, 3
				Green Central Banking refers to central banks deliberately using their monetary policy instruments to incentivise climate-friendly market activities. For instance, targeted green lending programmes, targeted green bond purchase programmes, ""brown penalties"" (higher interest rates for pollution-intensive banks or businesses), lowering the financing rate for banks that offer collateral with a smaller carbon footprint, and mandatory disclosures of climate risks.
				For the purposes of this debate, green central banking would support climate-friendly policies even at the expense of traditional monetary objectives such as targeting inflation rates, ensuring financial stability and market efficiency, as well as retaining neutrality of intervention.

				Multi-Speed Europe is a scenario where existing Member States in the European Union integrate at different paces, where certain Member States opt in doing more in specific policy areas, while others opt out. This would not apply retroactively, so existing policies would remain unified, but new policies would be differentially adopted. These may cover policies such as defence, internal security, taxation or social matters.

				Humans have inherent traits that consist of their core personality and preferences. These get transferred through reincarnations and do not change. People are a combination of their inherent traits and their environment.
