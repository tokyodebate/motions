				In Spain there are two ways financial autonomy is exercised by autonomous regions:
				In the common regime the central government is in charge of setting and collecting most taxes, which it then redistributes between all the autonomous regions with the aim of reducing inequalities between regions. This implies that richer regions become net contributors to the system, while poorer ones become net recipients. Catalonia is currently under a common regime. 
				The second regime is a chartered regime, where as long as regions pay a fixed amount to the central government, they are allowed full control over setting and collecting non-VAT taxes (including raising or lowering tax). Currently only Basque Country and Navarre have a chartered regime.

			THS Green Central Banking
				OG $stats 4, 0
				OO $stats 3, 1
				CG $stats 0, 4
				CO $stats 1, 3

				For the purposes of this debate, green central banking would support climate-friendly policies even at the expense of traditional monetary objectives such as targeting inflation rates, ensuring financial stability and market efficiency, as well as retaining neutrality of intervention.

				CG $stats 1, 0
				CO $stats 0, 1
				Multi-Speed Europe is a scenario where existing Member States in the European Union integrate at different paces, where certain Member States opt in doing more in specific policy areas, while others opt out. This would not apply retroactively, so existing policies would remain unified, but new policies would be differentially adopted. These may cover policies such as defence, internal security, taxation or social matters.

				CO $stats 0, 1
				For the purposes of this debate reincaraction is real. It happens in human form only, in a random (not karmic) way, and doesn't have to follow immediately after death. 
				This is known to all and considered an undisputable fact. 
				Humans have inherent traits that consist of their core personality and preferences. These get transferred through reincarnations and do not change. People are a combination of their inherent traits and their environment.
