			TH, as Iran, would accept the ‘Iran Deal Plus’.
				In 2015 Iran signed the ‘Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action’, also known as the Iran Deal. In exchange for committing to denuclearisation and allowing UN inspection of their nuclear sites, the international community would unfreeze Iranian assets and remove economic sanctions. In 2018 President Donald Trump removed the United States from the deal. In 2020 Iran formally announced it would no longer comply with the deal. Joe Biden has indicated his willingness to resume the Iran Deal. Other parties to the deal like Germany have suggested they would require an ‘Iran Deal Plus’ to re-enter. An Iran Deal Plus would involve Iran making additional concessions, perhaps including the dismantling of its ballistic missile program or ceasing funding extremist groups throughout the Middle East.

			Assuming feasibility, THBT the Holy Kaaba should be under the custody/guardianship of the OIC, instead of Saudi Arabia.
				The Kaaba is a cube shaped building at the center of Islam's most important mosque, (Masjid al Haram) in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. It is the most sacred site in Islam and is considered by Muslims to be the House of God. Muslims orient themselves toward this building during the five daily prayers, bury their dead facing its meridian, and visit it on pilgrimage. The Saudi government's oversight of the building complex marks one of its primary claims to authority and legitimacy in the Muslim world. The Saudi King bears the title of official custodian.
				The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation is an international organisation consisting of 57 member states, with a collective population of over 1.8 billion. The organisation states that it is "the collective voice of the Muslim world" and works to "safeguard and protect the interests of the Muslim world in the spirit of promoting international peace and harmony".
