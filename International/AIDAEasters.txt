Australian Intervarsity Debating Championships (Easters)
	Sydney Easters 2018
		Round 1
			That Australia should abolish its state governments.
			That we should allow binding citizen-initiated plebiscites.
				A binding citizen-initiated plebiscite is a national vote which, if it passes, directly changes the law, without the need for approval by parliament. They are initiated by voters.
			That we should appoint the Senate by random lottery.
		Round 2
			That, when funding or approving research, we should not consider whether it is potentially controversial.
				Academic research is usually funded by either universities or government research councils. If research is considered likely to be controversial (for example if it relates to areas such as sex differences in intelligence or radical political theory), it may be less likely to receive funding.
			That we should abolish all exit rankings of high school students (e.g. the ATAR).
			That universities should financially compensate students who have tried, but been unable, to gain employment in a field relevant to their studies within 5 years of graduation.
		Round 3
			That judges should not consider victim impact statements or character evidence in sentencing.
			That we should ban plea bargains in criminal trials.
				A plea bargain is where an accused criminal is offered a more lenient sentence in exchange for pleading guilty and forgoing a trial.
			That women around the world should not be taxed.
				UNICEF estimates that women do 66% of the world’s work for less than 10% of its income.
		Round 4
			That we regret the decline of gaybourhoods.
				Gaybourhoods are urban areas with generally recognised boundaries that unofficially form a social centre for LGBT people (eg. Castro in San Francisco, the Greenwich Village in New York, Newtown in Sydney). They are less common and exclusive than has historically been the case.
			That, as a parent, we would actively encourage our child to invest in their appearance and physical attractiveness.
			That we would prefer a world where sex and love are viewed and conceived of as separate.
		Round 5
			That charities should not host events that require participants to emulate the experiences of those for whom they are raising money (eg. 40 Hour Famine, CEO Sleep Out, Live Below the Line)
			That the Left should use the tactic of doxxing alt-right/nazi sympathisers.
				Doxxing is the practice of publicly exposing an individual’s personal details and/or details of their behaviour.
			That we should remove all legal restrictions on the right of workers to strike.
				There are legal restrictions on the right to strike. They include (but are not limited to) that it is illegal to strike if you are an emergency service worker, if it is not during enterprise bargaining negotiations, if the relevant industrial tribunal has not approved it, and if the strike is in protest of national or state laws regarding workers’ rights or living standards (as compared to your specific workplace). Employees are not paid while on strike.
		Round 6
			That we should allow doctors to prescribe placebos for the treatment of symptoms without informing their patient that they are placebos.
				Placebos are imitation versions of a medical treatment, which do not contain the active ingredient or correct procedure of the treatment (for example, a “sugar pill” instead of Paracetamol, the active ingredient in Panadol). They have been shown to psychologically affect a patient, often mimicking the impact of the active ingredient. A symptom is something a patient feels as a result of a condition (eg. pain, anxiety, distress) as opposed to the condition itself (eg. an infection or disease).
			That, assuming the players are fully informed of the risk, we support the right of athletes to play violent sports (eg. NFL/GridIron, Boxing).
			That we should ban rehabilitation and/or recovery service providers from including religious beliefs as part of their treatment.
		Octofinals
			That developing nations should adopt near-0% corporate tax rates.
			That we should abolish the requirement to prove an ongoing connection to land in Native Title claims.
				Native Title is the legal recognition within the Australian legal system of the traditional rights and interests of Indigenous Australians in land. Native Title is only recognised if the claimant can prove an ‘ongoing connection’ to the land in question. When Native Title is recognised, this does not always result in the relevant Indigenous group being granted land rights or control over that land.
			That Western nations which militarily intervene in a state should take a significant number of refugees from that state.
		Quarterfinals
			That families and/or doctors should be allowed to involuntarily commit individuals that express violent intentions even when they have no other mental health disturbance.
				At the moment, individuals can only be involuntarily committed to psychiatric care if they have a diagnosed mental health condition and are presenting severe symptoms (eg. suicide risk, mania, extreme delusions.
			That we would prefer a world without empathy.
				Empathy is the emotional response/ability to adopt the feelings and experiences of another. It is not the rational consideration of those things.
			That we should refocus history to emphasise the wrong-doings and moral failings of historical figures to an equal or greater extent than their positive contributions.
				There is extensive evidence that Mahatma Ghandi sexually exploited young women, including his great niece. // Mother Theresa denied medically necessary abortion, likely mismanaged large amounts of money, and allegedly kept patients in pain as “the world gains much from their suffering”. // Winston Churchill directed the British government to export food out of India during the Bengal famine of 1943, in which 3 million Indians died of starvation. // Thomas Jefferson owned slaves and serially raped one of them, Sally Hemings.
		Semifinals
			That Australia should legalise and reward bounty hunting.
				A bounty hunter is someone who locates and captures criminals and other people accused of crimes, in exchange for a monetary award – a bounty. They are not a member of law enforcement. Bounty hunting is illegal in Australia but legal in some states in the US.
			That we should abolish the recidivist premium and provide a sentencing discount to offenders with criminal records.
				Most jurisdictions impose a ‘recidivist premium’ on offenders who have previously committed a crime, which increases the severity and/or length of their sentence.
			That we should force symbolic death penalty states to carry out a prisoner’s death sentence at that prisoner’s request.
				Nevada has only 1000 prisoners on death row, but has executed only 22 people in the last 40 years. Such states are referred to as ‘symbolic death penalty states’.
		Grand Final
			That progressives should abandon the rhetoric of the lottery of birth.
			That we regret the popularisation of performance and skills previously associated with sex work (eg. Pole Dancing, Burlesque Strip Tease).
			That we support the use of violence as a tactic for fighting oppression.

			That we should implement a quota for Indigenous Australians in Federal Parliament
		Round 2
			That we support juries returning a verdict of not guilty when they believe the defendant is technically guilty but that a conviction would be unjust
			That non-violent crimes committed by a significant proportion of the population (e.g. internet piracy, jaywalking, possession of marijuana, etc.) should be automatically decriminalised
			That we regret the rise of shows (eg. Serial, Making a Murderer) that undertake detailed investigations into criminal cases
		Round 3
			That the Government should tax companies’ use of technology that is replacing human labour
			That we should allow young people to opt out of specific protections of workers’ rights when applying for jobs (eg. minimum wage, maximum working hours, penalty rates)
			That the Australian Government should focus on increasing accessibility and reliability of rental properties (eg. long-term leases, greater protections for tenants), rather than on the accessibility of home ownership
		Round 4
			That we regret the argument of identity politics that you only have a politically legitimate position on an issue if you are a member of the affected group
			This House regrets the dominance of sex-positive feminism

			That the European Union should pursue the harshest possible deal for the UK during Brexit
			That we should allow states to pay other states to relocate and resettle refugees
