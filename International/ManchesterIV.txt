				Infoslide A:
				"I can buy myself flowers
				Write my name in the sand
				Talk to myself for hours
				Say things you don't understand
				I can take myself dancing
				And I can hold my own hand
				Yeah, I can love me better than you can
				Can love me better
				I can love me better, baby
				Can love me better
				I can love me better, baby"
				Infoslide B:
				"There's a thin line between love and hate
				Don't come back here, trust me
				No hard feelings, babe, I wish you
				Good luck with my so-called replacement
				I don't even know what happened
				You're acting so weird, I don't even recognize you
				I'm worth two 22-year-olds
				You traded in a Ferrari for a Twingo
				You traded in a Rolex for a Casio
				You're all worked up, slow down
				Ah, so much time at the gym
				But maybe work out your brain a bit too"

				Recently in the United States numerous Progressive Prosecutors have been elected on platforms that include abandoning cash bail, declining to prosecute low-level charges, not pursuing marijuana cases and closely scrutinising police conduct, in efforts to reform a system that they say over-incarcerates and disproportionately punishes poor, minority communities

				Shadow banking refers to intermediary financial activities that are not subject to the banking system’s regulatory oversight. Examples are hedge funds, investment banks, private equity funds, money market funds, special purpose entity conduits (SPE), and structured investment vehicles (SIVs). Unlike commercial banks, shadow banks don’t take public deposits as a source of funding. They also do not have access to central bank funding, interbank loans, or public sector credit guarantees.

				The Satanic Verses, written by writer Salman Rushdie, was published in 1988. The book was inspired by the life of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The novel has been accused of blasphemy for its reference to the Quranic Satanic Verses - a set of "satanic suggestions" which Muhammad is alleged to have mistaken for divine revelation. Fearing unrest, the book was banned in India.
