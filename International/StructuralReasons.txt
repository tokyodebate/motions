				"Lustration" is a policy which involves the temporary removal (usually a period of 20–30 years) and political exclusion, often without trial, of officials at all levels of the political system associated with former regimes and their political parties, e.g. officials associated with the communist parties in Central and Eastern Europe after the collapse of the Soviet Union. This process is normally conducted by the new, more democratic establishment.

				Jean Valjean is a fugitive prisoner in late 18th-century France who is sent to jail for many years for stealing a loaf of bread and then has his sentence extended for his many escape attempts. After finally escaping from prison, he is saved by a priest and becomes a god-fearing man who dedicates himself to doing good. He adopts a fake identity and becomes a mayor and philanthropist who employs many poor people. Recently, he found out that an innocent man, whose only crime is that he looks similar to Valjean, is mistakenly believed to be Valjean himself and is about to be sent to prison for the rest of his life unless proven innocent.
