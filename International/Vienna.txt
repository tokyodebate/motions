				Vienna is often dubbed the "Capital of Spies".
				Historically, Vienna has been a hub for espionage activities, particularly during the Cold War, due to its strategic location and political neutrality. A 1956 ruling by the Austrian Supreme Court only criminalizes espionage directed against Austria, effectively legalizing spying on foreign entities within the country, which adds to the city's attractiveness for intelligence agencies.
				Today, Vienna as it is home to over 7,000 agents and spies, making it the city with the highest concentration of espionage activity in the world. The city hosts numerous international and diplomatic organizations, including the United Nations Headquarters (UN), the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).

				Since 2006, the United States has imposed a wide variety of sanctions on Venezuela. Among other aims, these prevent the Venezuelan government from accessing the U.S. financial system, freeze the bank accounts of the Maduro administration and block oil imports from the state oil and gas company. In 2017, Donald Trump tightened the sanctions with the aim of ousting Maduro in favour of an interim opposition government led by Juan Guaidó.
				Recently, Joe Biden took limited steps towards lifting sanctions on Venezuela, including allowing very limited natural resource extraction operations in Venezuela by the U.S. firm Chevron. The vast majority of US sanctions remain in place.
