				A "Love is Blind" dating model is a dating model where all dates conducted with a person are done so that you cannot see the other person. You can go on as many dates as you want but you don’t get to see the person until you have decided to be in a committed relationship. For the sake of debate, assume that this is a widespread model of dating (i.e., as normal as dating through a dating app)

				OG $stats 2, 0

				CO $stats 0, 2
				A "relationship credit score" is a score that is given to an individual based on a number of set rules, where good behavior in relationships improves one’s score and bad behavior in relationship decreases one’s score. Any individual can access another's score via a website. For the sake of debate, assume that relationship credit score organizations have access to the necessary information to score on a set of criteria.

			THP a world where the dominant norm is that people believe in an internal locus of control rather than an external locus of control
				OG $stats 0, 1
				OO $stats 1, 0
				CG $stats 0, 1
				CO $stats 0, 1
				Someone with an internal locus of control will believe that the things that happen to them are greatly influenced by their own abilities, actions, or mistakes. A person with an external locus of control will tend to feel that other forces—such as random chance, social structures, environmental factors, or the actions of others—are more responsible for the events that occur in the individual's life.
