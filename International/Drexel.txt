				A balanced budget amendment is a constitutional rule that aims to prevent a state from spending more than its income. Therefore, it requires states implement policies with the goal of maintaining a balance between the government's projected revenues and expenses. Balanced budget amendments include exceptions for extreme cases such as wars, recessions, or national emergencies, which must be approved by a majority in parliament.

				Positive and negative memory laws are legal measures adopted by some countries to regulate the public discourse and historical narrative related to specific events or periods of their history. These laws aim to influence how historical events are remembered and discussed, and they can have significant implications for freedom of speech, historical research, and public memory.
				Positive Memory Laws: Laws that promote or mandate a particular version of historical events, often focusing on the positive aspects of a nation's history or emphasizing national pride. These laws may aim to protect the country's image, foster patriotism, or prevent the dissemination of information that could be considered harmful to the country's reputation.
				Negative Memory Laws: Laws that prohibit or penalize the discussion, acknowledgment, or recognition of certain historical events that may be considered controversial or politically sensitive. These laws are typically enacted to suppress discussions related to events that the government wishes to downplay or keep hidden from public scrutiny.
