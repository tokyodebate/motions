			TH, as an up and coming lawyer from a minority background in the US, would choose to be an 'adversarial lawyer' instead of a 'moral activist' lawyer
				OG $stats 3, 1

				CO $stats 1, 3
				An adversarial lawyer believes their duty is to advocate for their client's interest as zealously as possible and believe that they are not morally responsible for either the ends or means of representation, provided they are lawful.
				A moral activist lawyer sees forwarding social justice as their primary duty. They aim to improve substantive justice through: public interest lawyering, law reform activities, and counselling clients to act morally.

				Essentialism is the view that things (objects, people, ideas, or categories) have some fixed, intrinsic nature or essence that makes them what they are. For example, believing that "gender," "national identity," or "human nature" have stable, universal qualities that exist independently of context. 
				Anti-essentialism (or emptiness) is the view that things do not have intrinsic essences. Instead, they are contingent, relational, and shaped by perspective and context. For example, "gender roles" or "national character" are seen as social constructions that change across cultures and histories, rather than fixed truths.

				CO $stats 8, 5, 3, 9
				For the purposes of this debate, faith in humanity consists of (1) the belief that people are decent and good at heart (2) the desire to encourage people to do good, even at the expense of significant personal sacrifice. Prominent examples include Mohandas Gandhi, who urged his followers to treat as "an article of faith" the view that there is "no one so fallen" that he cannot be "converted by love"

				CO $stats 5, 5, 6, 9
				Non-attachment is the practice of overcoming emotional attachment to things or people. A non-attached person can still value and take care of things and people, but builds enough emotional distance to prevent feeling distress if they were damaged or taken away.

Javier Milei, the frontrunner in Argentina's upcoming presidential election, supports ending the crisis through radical free market policies. His policies include, but are not limited to: ending currency controls and seeking the dollarization of the Argentinian economy, significant reductions in government spending, and the flexibilization of labor markets.

				You are a medical practitioner who, by happy coincidence, ended up drinking with Anthony Fauci, the head of the American National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, and former medical advisor to President Biden. Having gotten extremely drunk, Mr. Fauci reveals to you, with irrefutable evidence, that the COVID-19 pandemic was in fact a "plandemic", and that the virus was released deliberately to test the extent to which the US government can control and manipulate its population. The vaccines were never really efficient and were but a ploy to earn profit for the pharmaceutical industry. The next morning, Fauci doesn't remember telling you anything and remains unaware that you possess the information.
