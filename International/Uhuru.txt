				You are an all-rounded high school graduate who performed well in your university entrance exams and extracurriculars. However, you’re unsure of what you wish to study in university and are only considering doing a Bachelor of Liberal Studies (BLS) or an apprenticeship. The purpose of the BLS degree is to provide students with a solid multidisciplinary preparation in the Humanities, Natural Sciences, Social Sciences and the Arts. An apprenticeship is where you learn how to do a specific job or trade in a real workplace while studying at a training provider. You can start one at any stage in your career or life. Completing an apprenticeship gives you a nationally recognised qualification. You can use your qualification to start your career or to do more training.

				In most universities, staff are trained in a rehabilitative approach that emphasize mediation and reconciliation in instances of bullying and harassment. This is usually the first step that is defaulted to and a prerequisite for escalating reports to a formal hearing at the university's disciplinary tribunal.

				CG $stats 3, 3, 6, 5

				In a first-past-the-post voting system, countries are split into geographic, electoral districts. Voters cast their vote for one candidate of their choice, and the candidate who receives the most votes wins (even if the top candidate gets less than 50%).
				A hung parliament describes a situation in which no particular political party has an absolute majority (i.e. holds less than 51% of the seats).

				OO $stats 2, 8, 12, 5
				CG $stats 7, 11, 5, 4
				CO $stats 9, 1, 3, 14
				In recent years, many sports leagues have overseen the creation or expansion of leagues and/or tournaments playing modified short-form versions of their respective sports. Often these short-form versions are characterised by a faster pace, shorter games, fewer players per side, and/or simpler rules. Examples include T20 and The Hundred (cricket), Rugby 7s and RugbyX (rugby), Fast4 Tennis, 3x3 Basketball, etc.

				CO $stats 4, 7, 8, 7
				Indonesia is an archipelago made up of provinces with diverse ethnic, religious and language groupings. In recent years there have been increasing pushes for regional autonomy and even secession in several regions of Indonesia that are religiously, culturally, or politically distinct from the Javanese majority (e.g. the Free Aceh Movement and the Free Papua Movement). In response to this, the Indonesian government has taken some steps towards devolution - for instance, the province of Aceh has been granted special autonomous status and is the only province in Indonesia to officially practice sharia law.

				CG $stats 6, 8, 3, 9
				CO $stats 10, 4, 8, 4
				For the purposes of this debate, prescriptivism refers to the view that labels have specific, unchanging meanings and ought be used "correctly" (i.e. by those who fit the definition of that label). Descriptivism refers to the view that labels are flexible and can be used by anyone who feels comfortable with that term.

				Uriarra Village is a town with a population of 349 that is located west of Canberra. It is the only town in Australia held under "community title"; this means that the village community owns and maintains services and infrastructure including roads, community lands, the village hall, and stormwater. The village receives minimal services from the state government and has a degree of independence in passing local regulations.

				CO $stats 1, 1
				China currently uses a system of household registration called the "hukou". This system links an individual’s household registration to a specific municipality and prevents them from permanently settling outside of their home city. Migrant workers without a local hukou cannot access public education, most welfare benefits, and some other services in their new cities. Individuals can apply to transfer their hukou, but must generally meet strict conditions such as home ownership or qualified employment. Conditions to apply for a local hukou have become lower in smaller cities in recent years but remain high in mid-sized and larger cities.

			THS a multi-speed integration of the African Union
				OG $stats 0, 1
				OO $stats 0, 1
				CG $stats 0, 1
				CO $stats 1, 0
				Multi-speed integration is a scenario where existing member states integrate at different paces, where certain member states opt into greater integration in specific policy areas, while others opt out. This would not apply retroactively, so existing policies would remain unified, but new policies would be differentially adopted. 
				In the African Union, salient policy issues include a common currency, common market, free movement of people, tariff harmonization, and a defence pact/consensual peacekeeping forces.
