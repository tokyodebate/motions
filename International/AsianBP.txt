				The Golden Triangle is a hotbed of criminal activity at the border of Laos, China, Thailand, and Myanmar. It is one of the world's largest drug trafficking corridors both into and out of China, hosting scam centers, illegal gambling operations, and human trafficking dens. Most illicit activity is centered in a Special Economic Zone protected by Laos' government where large organised crime groups from Mainland China are allowed to operate casinos, some of which are rumored to have ties to high-ranking CCP officials. The Thai army polices the border both to curtail crime and to secure its territorial claim.

				Industrial Policy is defined as the strategic effort by the state to encourage economic transformation by specifically advantaging what it deems to be high-potential sectors. Industrial Policy fell out of favor in the 1990s after the Washington Consensus, under which the International Monetary Fund (IMF) opposed tactics by states to control their own economic trajectory rather than letting market forces decide. Industrial Policy has seen a recent revival through policies like the US Inflation Reduction Act, the EU Chips Act, and Made in China Act 2025.

				 (1) A private equity firm is a type of investment firm open to a select group of investors that acquires companies with the aim of either improving them and selling them at a profit later down the line, or selling the company's assets for more than they bought it for. (2) Most private equity firms acquire companies through Leveraged Buyouts (LBOs) which involves borrowing a large proportion of the money needed to purchase a company and paying it off through the income generated by the company's operations. The debt obligations are typically forced onto the company being acquired, meaning the private equity firm itself is not liable for any potential default and its credit worthiness is unaffected.

			THBT ethnic Chinese communities in Southeast Asia should aggressively distance themselves from China (eg. rejecting "finding your roots" trips to China, identifying as culturally distinct to Mainland China, avoiding doing business or study in China despite China's overseas-Chinese-friendly policies)

				"Ethnic Chinese" persons refer to foreign nationals of ancestral Chinese descent, but whose political identification aligns to the country they are citizens of (e.g., ethnic Chinese groups who are citizens of Malaysia). China has sought to build connections with ethnic Chinese groups outside of China. Examples include inviting ethnic Chinese individuals to China's Two Sessions parliamentary meeting, including ethnic Chinese participants at Chinese business conventions, appealing to young ethnic Chinese inviduals to learn Mandarin, and framing the 2024 Chinese New Year Gala Performance as being for "all Chinese" globally.

				However, over the past decade anti-democratic tendencies have been identified in the young Central and Eastern European member states. Erosions of democracy have progressed furthest in Hungary and Poland: In Hungary, the concentration of power under Prime Minister Victor Orbán has steadily increased since 2010, and in 2020, in response to the coronavirus pandemic, the Hungarian Parliament approved a bill to make the state of emergency indefinite and grant the ability for Prime Minister Orbán to rule by decree. Poland has also seen continuous erosions such as measures that undermine the independence of the judiciary, allow the ruling party to dominate the media, and silence criticism from civil society. Threats to media freedom were seen in Czech Republic and Slovakia in 2018 and Croatia, Lithuania, Bulgaria and Romania faced problems in the fields of corruption and threats to the independence of the judiciary

			THBT Pakatan Harapan should have opted to remain a strong Opposition instead of forming a unity government with Barisan Nasional
				On the 19th of November 2022, the nation wide Malaysian General Elections saw (then Opposition), centre-left coalition Pakatan Harapan (PH) attain the highest number of seats (81) in Parliament. The party with the next highest number of seats won was far right coalition Perikatan Nasional (PN) (74) led by Muhyiddin Yassin. With no party or coalition attaining a simple majority (112), this resulted in a hung parliament. To resolve this, Pakatan Harapan joined forces with other parties most notably the embattled centre right wing coalition, Barisan Nasional (BN). This led to the formation of the country's first unity government helmed by Anwar Ibrahim.

		R3
			This House believes that the queer community should oppose the glorification of white gender-fluid icons (e.g. Harry Styles, Ruby Rose, Troye Sivan, Nico Tortorella, Sam Smith, etc.)
				A person who identifies as gender-fluid has a gender identity and presentation that varies over time. A gender-fluid person may identify as male, female, agender, or any other nonbinary identity or combination of identities. Gender fluidity does not affect sexual preference or orientation.

				A counterculture is a culture whose values and norms of behavior differ substantially from or oppose those of mainstream society
		R7
			In cases where a public official is accused of corruption, this House would lower the evidentiary standard to “balance of probability” instead of “beyond reasonable doubt”
				The "balance of probability" standard means that a court is satisfied an event occurred - if the court considers that, on the evidence, the occurrence of the event was more likely (probable) than not. "Beyond reasonable doubt" is a higher standard of proof that requires convincing the court that based on the evidence, there is no reason to doubt that the accused is guilty.

			This House prefers a world where religions adopted the concept of "God's light"

		GF
			This House prefers to live as a person who adopted the "closed off" model
				The "closed off" model refers to a way of life where individuals are more protective of themselves, do not express their emotions much and tend to not give away personal details about themselves. The "openness" model refers to a way of life where individuals freely express their emotions, tend to share personal information with acquaintances and friends (even if not close) and are more emotionally vulnerable.

		R3
			THW grant the WHO, in times of crisis, coercive powers to gather information about suspected infectious disease outbreaks and to enforce its policy recommendations.
				Coercive powers include the power to levy economic and financial sanctions and to stage interventions. These interventions could constitute sending information-gathering teams (which are analogous to weapons inspectors that enforce nuclear non-proliferation and anti-chemical weapons treaties) and medical teams to reinforce public health systems. The World Health Organization (WHO) makes a wide variety of policy recommendations during epidemics and pandemics regarding disease outbreak reporting, travel and trade restrictions, and lockdown measures.
		R4
			THBT investors should be required to invest a significant proportion of their portfolios in the real economy.
				The real economy concerns the production, purchase and flow of goods and services (like oil, bread and labour) within an economy. It is contrasted with the financial economy, which concerns the aspects of the economy that deal purely in transactions of fiat money and other financial assets, which represent ownership or claims to ownership of real sector goods and services.

				In the Islamic faith, a fatwa is a non-binding but authoritative legal opinion or learned interpretation issued by a qualified religious leader, pertaining to Islamic law and ethics. Followers are expected to adhere to these rulings. Wahhabism is an Islamic doctrine and religious movement that is often described as ultraconservative and puritan.

Following Russia’s annexation of Crimea and invasion of Ukraine, NATO agreed to forward deploy four multinational battalion battle groups to NATO members most at risk of a possible Russian attack – specifically Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty enshrines the principle of collective defence, where an armed attack against one member state must be deemed to be an armed attack against all member states.
