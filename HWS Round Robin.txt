HWS Round Robin
  HWS Round Robin 2022
    R1:
      As a charity successfully making the world better, this house would reject donations from immoral actors.

    R2: 
      This house believes that companies should implement policies that require management to work entry level jobs periodically.

    R3: 
      This house would require laws that curtail individual freedom under the pretext of public health (e.g., vaccination requirements, mask mandates, lockdowns, etc.) to be confirmed by a referendum.

    R4: 
      This house prefers a world that includes the star chamber.
        The star chamber is a supernatural power (perhaps aliens) who randomly but accurately identify a small percentage of immoral action that would otherwise go unpunished, and then ensure that the perpetrators of these acts suffer to a degree that is proportionate to their offense.  This punishment is administered in such a way that no one (including the perpetrator) ever connects it to the immoral actions. 

    R5:  
      This house regrets major internet companies (e.g., Facebook, Google, etc.) operating on the basis of selling advertising as a business model.

    Finals: 
      THS increased military spending and rearmament plans announced by Germany and other EU countries."
