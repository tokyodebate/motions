			THW implement a system of voter insurance for national elections
				For the purpose of this debate, voter insurance is a scheme in which voters can vote to "purchase" insurance against a candidate winning, instead of voting for their favorable candidate.

			TH, as a gay person with a profound faith in Catholic, would dismiss the Pope's view for the sake of Catholic tradition
				Earlier this month, the Pope critisised laws to ban same sex marriage.

He mentioned that homosexual love itself should also be welcomed, which incites doubts from the consevatives.
