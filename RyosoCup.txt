				- Japanese university students start looking for a job 1-2 years before graduating.
				- Japanese university students are accustomed into wearing the same black colored suits, white shirts, striped ties and black shoes, when they attend interviews or seminars held by companies.
				- There are many websites, books and other publications that tells you what you write in CVs and answers to questionnaires that they submit to companies. They even tell ou the standard answers to questions raised in interviews, standard 1--2 minites speeches that you do not have to customize to make it original, or even what hairstyle you should have.
				Shūkatsu is said to be created by a few very large companies that monopilize the jobhunting and recruiting market, like Recruit Corp and MyNavi Corp.
				These companies offer sesrvices to allow a client to entirely or partially outsource the recruiting process to them, such as
				- Providing an online platform for contacting with students, together with providing consultancies on what to say and what contents to put up on the platform to make the client more attractive to students.
				- Screening out students that have not graduated from prestigious universities, or performed poorly on IQ tests or academic tests that are made by these companies.
				- Conducting interviews instead of the client, or oroviding the client with consultancies on what to ask in an interview and how the client should score the interviews.
				At the same time, to students, they approach to the students by
				- Providing lectures on how to perform well in interviews and tests
				- Nudging them to start studying about the right company for themselves by attending events and seminars held by the companies from a very early stage
