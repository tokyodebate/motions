An example of disaster capitalism is after the Earthquake and Tsunami in South Asia where developers acquired land to build resorts and other ventures while local farmers and residents were evacuating their homes.

				The "space army", which is an army of extraterrestrial life, is currently staying in a spaceship fleet floating above Japan. The captain of the fleet left the following message: "The president of our planet wants to make a contract with Japan. We will occupy certain spaces of the nation and use it as bases to 'explore and study' Earth. If the Kishida administration refuses this contract, we will 'take necessary and forceful means' to achieve our goal." Note that the Kishida administration needs to respond within 48 hours.
