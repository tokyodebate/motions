				Furusato Nouzei is the state led scheme of incentivising people to donate their money to any given local governments. Generally, when you make a donation to a local government, a portion of the donation amount is deducted from your income tax and inhabitant tax. The common practice of local governments under this scheme is to give donors gifts in return for their donation. Currently, they are allowed to provide goods which cost no more than 30% of donated amount.
