Through this logic, he defends many atrocities like the British-led slave trade and the Amritsar massacre of 1919. The book is heavily criticised as determinedly revisionist, provocative and foolhardy.

		R1
			THBT the new agriculture law is in the interest of Indian farmers
				A new agriculture law in India was proposed last year that would allow Indian farmers to directly sell and negotiate prices for their products with private buyers like supermarket chains anywhere in India. Currently, Indian farmers can only sell their products in government-controlled markets called 'mandis'. The sales process in mandis is regulated through commission agents (CAs) who mediate between the farmers and traders. Although there is a minimum support price in mandis, the traders and CAs have built cartels where they control prices and speed of payments, with little transparency on the trade process. While this law would allow farmers to sell freely outside of mandis, the law sparked massive protests by farmers around India due to fears of further deregulation and exploitation by corporations.

			TH prefers a common law system over a civil law system
				Legal systems around the world generally follow either a common law system or a civil law system. In a common law system (e.g. US, UK), judges take an active role in shaping the laws. Decisions by the court establish precedent for future cases. Judges interpret laws and apply to specific cases based on established precedents. In a civil law system (e.g. Japan, Germany) lawmakers and legal scholars hold stronger influence. Legislated laws clearly define cases that can be brought to court, the procedures for handling claims, and the punishment for an offense. Judges merely evaluate the facts of each case and make decisions using the conditions stated in the applicable law.
