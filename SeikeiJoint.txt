The media have focused on this place in recent years as a symbol of young people's loneliness, along with some delinquency and other problems (e.g. alcohol, tobacco, sugar-dating, overdose of drugs, deliberate self-harming, etc.) of 'To-yoko kids'. More and more children have come in the past few years, and the administration has been trying to deal with this issue.
