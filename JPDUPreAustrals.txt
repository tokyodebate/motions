			That development aid should be given based on cash-on-delivery scheme
				Cash-on-Delivery is the scheme for development aid that focuses on the results, encourages innovation and strengthens government accountability to citizens rather than donors. Under Cash-on-Delivery aid, donors would pay for measurable and verifiable progress on specific outcomes, such as $100 dollars for every child above baseline expectations who completes primary school and takes a test. When recipients cannot achieve the goal of what they are expected before having the contracts, aid from donors is going to decrease than before or stops.
