				Alphanumeric Grading System: Student performance is quantified using objective scores like GPA. This system is widely used in many universities and serves as a standardized metric for both internal and external evaluation (e.g., by employers and graduate schools).
				Non-alphanumeric Grading System: In contrast, this system uses only qualitative feedback (e.g., detailed written comments from professors) and self-reflection to assess students. It has been adopted in some universities (e.g., Hampshire College, Brown University).

				Traditionally, the space industry has been driven by governments and international organizations through large-scale cooperation.
				However, in recent years, the privatization of space has rapidly advanced in pursuit of cost reduction and efficiency. Notably, NASA now outsources many core transport services to private companies such as SpaceX and Boeing.
				This includes deploying commercial communication satellites, transporting supplies like food to ISS, launching military and reconnaissance satellites, sending scientific instruments, exploration rovers, and commercial crew into space.

				The number of academic journals has been rising. In 2020, WordsRated estimated about 46,700 journals.
				Behind this growth is the "Publish or perish" culture, where many universities and research institutions evaluate researchers based on the quantity of their published papers.
				Another major factor is the rise of Open Access (OA) journals, facilitated by the internet. Unlike traditional subscription models, OA journals make articles free for everyone to read by charging authors high publication fees.

				You are a traditional Kabuki actor from a prestigious family line. You have two disciples, Kikuo and Shunsuke. Kikuo isn't related by blood, while Shunsuke is your biological son. Kikuo is talented and has been training diligently since he was a child. He is expected to become an exceptional actor, but he is the son of a Yakuza gang leader. His father passed away and the gang was destroyed in a conflict. Shunsuke, on the other hand, has been feeling down ever since you assigned Kikuo a leading role in the upcoming grand stage. Although he has been practicing since he was young, recently he skips practice and chases women.The two have been good rivals and close friends since they began training together.
				Your diabetes is getting worse, and you are considering having one of them take over the family name. In the world of Kabuki, the actor's name (e.g. 市川團十郎) is passed down to the next generation. It represents the history and authority of the Kabuki family.

				The Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region is a province located in northeast China. From its establishment in 1952, the region has been granted high autonomy within their ethnic group. (e.g.  rights to their own language in education and government, and a degree of self-administration)
				They have long been celebrated as a "model minority". But recently they are facing pressure from the Chinese government as part of a nationwide "education for national unity" policy. Authorities in Yanbian began to systematically reduce and phase out the use of Korean as a language of instruction in schools.

				CO $stats 1, 0, 1, 5
				In the US, government funding for specific religions has traditionally been prohibited based on the constitutional principle of separation of church and state, as well as concerns about fairness to atheists and adherents of other religions. However, recent Supreme Court rulings have shifted this perspective, viewing state restrictions on public funds for religious purposes as unconstitutional.
				Notably, the Court ruled in 2020 that a Montana law prohibiting scholarships to religious schools violated the Free Exercise Clause, and in 2022, it deemed Maine's refusal to provide public funding to religious schools unconstitutional.

				In recent years, there has been a growing social norm that the ability to make an effort itself is a talent. This implies that those who can make an effort have this talent, while those who lack the talent to make an effort from the beginning will find it difficult or impossible to do so. Additionally, these claims are sometimes accompanied by some scientific evidence.

				You are an average high school girl. You don't have any particular hopes or dreams for the future, but your family is reasonably wealthy, and you lead a mundane yet happy life. You have a crush on a childhood friend. He is a violin prodigy, who aspires to become a violinist, but injured his arm in a car accident. It is impossible to heal his arm with modern medical technology, and doctors have told him to give up on becoming a violinist. As his childhood friend, you visit him every week, but he is on the verge of despair, and it pains you greatly to see him like this.One day, you came across Kyubey, who is not human but looks cute. He said, "Please become a ‘Magical Girl’ (魔法少女) by making a contract with me! If you do so, I'll grant you any one wish you want. It doesn’t matter what the wish is. I can even heal the arm of your friend. However, in return, you need to take on the role of defeating witches with your magical powers! Witches are invisible to ordinary people, extremely evil, and sometimes even kill them in secret. For example, many unexplained suspicious deaths and mass suicides are highly likely to be caused by witches. Only a magical girl can defeat them. Now there is no magical girl in this city and witches kill many innocent lives.You have enough talent to become a magical girl.SO, PLEASE MAKE A CONTRACT WITH ME AND BECOME A MAGICAL GIRL!"For the purpose of this debate, you have two choice1. Make the contract to heal your childhood friend’s arm. A magical girl needs to defeat witches to restore her magical energy; otherwise, cannot sustain her life. So you cannot escape from a harsh and irreversible fighting destiny if you make the contract.2. Reject the contract. Kyubey will then leave you, and you will live as an average woman.

				La Liga’s financial management rules" includes two notable regulations
				1)Squad Cost Limitation:
				The Squad Cost encompasses various factors such as players' total salaries, variable expenses, bonuses, player rights amortization, social security, pensions, and contract termination compensations.
				La Liga sets an upper limit on Squad Cost, mandating that clubs operate within this financial framework.
				2)4×1 Rule
				Clubs can allocate only 1/4 of the funds generated from player sales for acquiring new players.
				These rules restrict and ensures careful financial management of clubs.
				Lionel Messi achieved numerous titles with FC Barcelona, notably winning the Ballon d'Or seven times. He has also left an indelible mark on history by setting records such as being the all-time leading goal-scorer in La Liga and achieving remarkable goal-scoring feats in the UEFA Champions League. He has signed a huge salary contract with Barcelona for many years and has a strong attachment to the team.
				Barcelona is a team in La Liga. Barcelona faced financial challenges due to the accumulation of debts resulting from high player salaries.
				Despite attempting to hold down Squad Cost by selling young players, Barcelona still found itself in violation of La "Liga's financial management rules". La Liga, citing budgetary constraints, did not permit Barcelona to continue Messi's contract.
				Thus, Leonel Messi unwillingly left Barcelona and As of now, Leonel Messi is no longer with a La Liga team but is playing for Inter Miami, a club in the United States.
				For the purpose of the debate,we assume that Lionel Messi would have remained in Barcelona if La Liga had granted the contract as an exception.
